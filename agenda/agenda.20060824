3. I/O (20 minutes)
   - accept transcoder change?
     (see srfi/io/port-io-alt.html)
   - flush or keep update-transcoder?
   - add clear-output-port?
   - add clear-input-port (possibly as flush-input-port)?
   - can lookahead-u8 or get-u8 return something other than eof if
     the last operation on the port was a lookahead-u8 that returned
     eof but the underlying file/object was extended in the meantime?
   - must lookahead-u8 or get-u8 return eof if the last operation on the
     port was a lookahead-u8 that returned eof but the underlying
     file/object was extended in the meantime?
   - what happens with illegal byte sequences during textual i/o?
   - must lookahead-u8 or get-u8 raise an excption if the last operation
     on the port was a lookahead-u8 that raised an exception due to
     insufficient bytes but the underlying file/object was extended in the
     meantime?
   - do we want to translate different end-of-line conventions to linefeed?
   - should get-line recognize the Unicode line separator in adition to
     the specified or default end-of-line convention?  Should it recognize
     all common conventions even if they aren't the current one?
   - add open-bytes-output-port, get-output-bytes, open-string-output-port,
     get-output-string?

4. Core/library split (20 minutes)
   - number and size of libraries to be described by R6RS
   - size of "mimimal language" presented by document
   - congruence between R6RS document and R6RS libraries
   - hierarchies and something like Java's wild card syntax?
   - do wildcards apply outside of r6rs hierarchy?

5. adjourn
