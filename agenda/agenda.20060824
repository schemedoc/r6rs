3. I/O (20 minutes)
   - accept transcoder change?
     (see srfi/io/port-io-alt.html)
   - flush or keep update-transcoder?
   - add clear-output-port?
   - add clear-input-port (possibly as flush-input-port)?
   - can lookahead-u8 or get-u8 return something other than eof if
     the last operation on the port was a lookahead-u8 that returned
     eof but the underlying file/object was extended in the meantime?

4. Core/library split (20 minutes)
   - number and size of libraries to be described by R6RS
   - size of "mimimal language" presented by document
   - congruence between R6RS document and R6RS libraries
   - hierarchies and something like Java's wild card syntax?
