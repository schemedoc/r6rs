0. finalize agenda (1 minute)

1. action items (1 minute)
   - draft responses for each ticket 135 and 137+ (All)
   - record response votes (All)
   - draft responses for ticket numbers 166, 196, 198, 202, 204, 205,
     208-222, 224, 226-229, 231-233
   - need final resolution in responses for ticket numbers 150, 164
   - update ticket-nnn responses to reflect decisions:
     154: allow bytevectors to be self-evaluating (but not vectors or ())
     166: formal comment rejected
     225, 229, 223: strings are not immutable, string-set! in a separate
       library, string-ref preserved, string-ref returns character (aka
       Unicode scalar value), no variable-length strings (encourage SRFIs),
       allow direct creation of text ports (done in ticket 225 response?),
       report should say that string-ref and string-set! should be O(1),
       add string-for-each
     194: leave hash-table-immutable? but change "immutable" argument
       to hash-table-copy to a "mutable" argument
     196: formal comment rejected
     205: add cons*
     215: do not hyphenate bytevector, do not hyphenate hashtable
   - update r6rs to reflect additional decisions:
     - allow (case-lambda)
     - probably use "should" for programmer requirements that implementations
       are not required to enforce
