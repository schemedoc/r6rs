0. finalize agenda (1 minute)

1. action items (1 minute)
   - record response votes (All)
   - draft responses for ticket numbers 202, 208, 209, 210, 217, 221, 229
   - need final resolution in responses for ticket numbers 150, 164
   - update ticket-nnn responses to reflect decisions:
     183: adopt formal comment plus add current-error-port to simple i/o
          and replicate the three current-x-port procedures in port i/o;
          (the three current-x-port procedures do not return fresh ports
          each time)
     184: (Anton) draft kindler, gentler rejection respons
     186: adopt formal comment, clarify that if there are two ports
          connected to the same source, and reading from that source changes
          the source, then peeking on one port will make that character
          inaccessible via the other port.  also clarify that a read-char
          preceded by a peek-char returns the same character as the
          preceding peek-char even if port is unbuffered.
     194: leave hash-table-immutable? but change "immutable" argument
          to hash-table-copy to a "mutable" argument
     200: adopt Posix semantics for set-port-position! when underlying
          object is a file
     225, 229, 223: strings are not immutable, string-set! in a separate
           library, string-ref preserved, string-ref returns character
           (aka Unicode scalar value), no variable-length strings
           (encourage SRFIs), allow direct creation of text ports (done in
           ticket 225 response?), report should say that string-ref and
           string-set!  should be O(1), add string-for-each
   - update r6rs to reflect additional decisions:
     - allow (case-lambda)
     - probably use "should" for programmer requirements that implementations
       are not required to enforce

3. add proposed string <=> bytevector conversion routines? (5 minutes)
   - see https://r6rs.scheming.org/node/596

4. change the specifications of char-alphabetic?, char-whitespace?, and
   string-titlecase to conform with Unicode 5? (5 minutes)
   - see http://lists.r6rs.org/pipermail/r6rs-discuss/2007-April/002250.html

5. change bytevector extraction procedure semantics? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 200
   - draft response summary: keep current semantics
   - is response too detailed?
   - also, should we add file-length?

6. specify freshness/mutability of quasiquoted structure? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 204

7. should <body> allow mixing definitions with expressions? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 212

8. eliminate library export immutability loophole? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 208
   - impact on top-level body?
   - impact on lambda body?

9. should map return new list structure each time? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 220
   - option 1: entirely new list structure
   - option 2: not modify earlier return values

10. Rename "lookahead" procedure-name prefix to "look-ahead"? (5 minutes)
   - bottom of ticket 214
   - contrast with "bytevector" and "hashtable"
   - rationale: "the unhyphenated form is usually used as a noun"

11. Remove (r6rs when-unless)? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 211
   - should we move when and unless into the base library?

12. Make simple conditions more like records? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 210

13. Change exception handling protocol? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 221

14. Replace library form with library prefix? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 150

15. Export bindings for various literals? (10 minutes)
   - ticket 164
   - literals that can appear where non-literals are legitimate:
     - syntax-rules underscore (_), ellipses (...)
     - cond else
     - quasiquote unquote, unquote-splicing
     - quasisyntax unsyntax, unsyntax-splicing
     - others?
   - literals that can appear only where literals are legitimate:
     - case else
     - define-record-type fields, mutable, etc.
     - others?

16. adjourn
