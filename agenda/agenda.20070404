0. finalize agenda (1 minute)

1. action items (1 minute)
   - record response votes (All)
   - draft responses for ticket numbers 202, 208, 209, 210, 217, 221, 229
   - need final resolution in responses for ticket numbers 150, 164
   - update ticket-nnn responses to reflect decisions:
     184: (Anton) draft kindler, gentler rejection respons
     200: adopt Posix semantics for set-port-position! when underlying
          object is a file
     229: strings are not immutable, string-set! in a separate
          library, string-ref preserved, string-ref returns character
          (aka Unicode scalar value), no variable-length strings
          (encourage SRFIs), report should say that string-ref and
          string-set!  should be O(1), add string-for-each
   - update r6rs to reflect additional decisions:
     - allow (case-lambda)
     - probably use "should" for programmer requirements that implementations
       are not required to enforce

3. add proposed string <=> bytevector conversion routines? (5 minutes)
   - see https://r6rs.scheming.org/node/596

4. change the specifications of char-alphabetic?, char-whitespace?, and
   string-titlecase to conform with Unicode 5? (5 minutes)
   - see http://lists.r6rs.org/pipermail/r6rs-discuss/2007-April/002250.html

5. change bytevector extraction procedure semantics? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 200
   - draft response summary: keep current semantics
   - is response too detailed?
   - also, should we add file-length?

6. specify freshness/mutability of quasiquoted structure? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 204

7. should <body> allow mixing definitions with expressions? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 212

8. eliminate library export immutability loophole? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 208
   - impact on top-level body?
   - impact on lambda body?

9. should map return new list structure each time? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 220
   - option 1: entirely new list structure
   - option 2: not modify earlier return values

10. Rename "lookahead" procedure-name prefix to "look-ahead"? (5 minutes)
   - bottom of ticket 214
   - contrast with "bytevector" and "hashtable"
   - rationale: "the unhyphenated form is usually used as a noun"

11. Remove (r6rs when-unless)? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 211
   - should we move when and unless into the base library?

12. Make simple conditions more like records? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 210

13. Change exception handling protocol? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 221

14. Replace library form with library prefix? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 150

15. Export bindings for various literals? (10 minutes)
   - ticket 164
   - literals that can appear where non-literals are legitimate:
     - syntax-rules underscore (_), ellipses (...)
     - cond else
     - quasiquote unquote, unquote-splicing
     - quasisyntax unsyntax, unsyntax-splicing
     - others?
   - literals that can appear only where literals are legitimate:
     - case else
     - define-record-type fields, mutable, etc.
     - others?

16. bytevector aliasing severely impedes optimizations? (5 minutes)
    - ticket 201

17. change formal semantics? (5 minutes)
    - tickets 226 (drop library toplevel), 227 (drop define and begin^f)

18. eq? and eqv? should apply to all standardized objects (5 minutes)
    - ticket 155

19. asymmetry between fold-left and fold-right (5 minutes)
    - ticket 170

20. adjourn
