0. finalize agenda (1 minute)

1. action items from 6/6/2006 (5 minutes)
   - mail library->environment proposal (Kent)
   - carried over:
     - consider commitment for reference implementations (All)
     - complete and commit updated status report (Kent)
     - submit syntax srfi (Kent)
     - update library srfi (Matthew and Kent)
     - update reference implementation for arithmetic SRFI (Will)

2. status report (5 minutes)
   - any comments on June~9 status-report draft
   - should we forward it to the steering committee?
   - will we have an internal r6rs draft by mid-June?
   - is September~1 still a resonable target date for steering committee draft?

3. equiv? semantics for equal? (5 minutes)
   - see SRFI 85
   - not generalized to records

4. reprise: SRFI 1 procedures (10 minutes)
   - do we have a consistent set?
   - exists, forall, filter, find, fold-left, fold-right, partition,
     generalized-member, generalized-remove, generalized-assoc
     remq, remv, remove
   - should we add (lookup pred alist) => value or #f by analogy to find?
   - better names for generalized-{member,remove,assoc}
     - alternative: call generalized-member find-tail as in SRFI 1, leave out
       generalized-remove since programmers can fake it with filter, and
       leave out generlized-assoc since programmers can fake it with find

5. subsystem ratification (15 minutes)
   - do we need to ratify or just "reach concensus"?
   - Unicode---ready to ratify?
   - records---ready to ratify?
   - arithmetic
   - I/O
   - libraries
   - syntax
   - byte vectors
   - hash tables
   - enumerations
   - safe/unsafe mode
   - core/library split

6. hash tables (10 minutes)

7. enumerations (10 minutes)

8. mutability of pairs (10 minutes)

9. adjourn
