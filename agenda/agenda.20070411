0. finalize agenda (1 minute)

1. action items (1 minute)
   - record response votes (All)
   - draft concrete proposal for making conditions more like
     records---or not (ticket 210) (Mike)
   - draft concrete proposal for change in exception handling
     protocol---or not (ticket 221) (Mike)
   - redraft response for ticket 201 (Will) [done]
   - revise (shorten) draft response for ticket 200 (Kent) [done]
   - draft responses for ticket numbers
     208: eliminate library export immutability loophole
     209: Syntactic datums and datum values
     210: Why are simple conditions so different from records
     221: Recursive exception handling considered harmful
   - update ticket-nnn responses to reflect decisions:
     151: reject formal comment
     204: go with option B
     211: move when and unless into base library
     214: reject suggestion to replace "lookahead" with "look-ahead"
     216: reject comment; possibly add footnote acknowledging Boolean
     220: map should not modify earlier return values
     223: will add string <=> unicode conversion procedures with
          "replace" semantics
     229: mention that bytevectors can be used with record wrapper
          and srfi can replicate string functionality; string-ref
          and string-set *should* be O(1)
   - update r6rs to reflect additional decisions:
     - probably use "should" for programmer requirements that implementations
       are not required to enforce
     - change the specifications of char-alphabetic?, char-whitespace?, and
       string-titlecase to conform with Unicode 5?
       (http://lists.r6rs.org/pipermail/r6rs-discuss/2007-April/002250.html)
     - adopt Posix semantics for set-port-position! when underlying
       object is a file or bytevector output port, with unwritten bytes
       having unspecified values
     - move formal semantics to a nonnormative appendix
   - deferred until after April 15
     - add port-length and port-has-port-length? procedures
       and corresponding arguments to custom port makers?

   - awaiting technical decision

   + response does not yet reflect technical decision

   * questions/comments:
     135: Kent needs to fix first bullet point [done]
     189: Anton would like help with this response
     200: Kent needs to shorten this response [done]

2. end game
   - we have four days left to publish responses
   - same process as last time?
   - volunteer to clean up tickets
   - meetings before and after April 15

3. eliminate library export immutability loophole? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 208
   - motion 1: include implicit only-once wrapper around rhs of each
     library definition
     - options: should or must raise exception?
   - motion 2: include implicit only-once wrapper around rhs of each
     definition, letrec, and letrec* rhs
     - options: should or must raise exception?

4. keep the other little library: (r6rs case-lambda)? (5 minutes)
   - we moved when-unless into (r6rs base), what about case-lambda?

5. Export bindings for various literals? (10 minutes)
   - ticket 164
   - literals that can appear where non-literals are legitimate:
     - syntax-rules underscore (_), ellipses (...)
     - cond else
     - quasiquote unquote, unquote-splicing
     - quasisyntax unsyntax, unsyntax-splicing
     - others?
   - literals that can appear only where literals are legitimate:
     - case else
     - define-record-type fields, mutable, etc.
     - others?
   - literals in the library syntax not (presently) an issue
     - export, import
     - only, rename, etc.
     - and, or, >, etc.
   - tabled last week when Matthew dropped out

6. change formal semantics? (5 minutes)
   - tickets 226 (drop library toplevel), 227 (drop define and begin^f)
   - Will says we should do what the formal comment suggests

7. should formal semantics contain "complicating optimizations"
   - ticket 222

8. eq? and eqv? should apply to all standardized objects (5 minutes)
   - ticket 155
   - Will believes the draft response is incorrect

9. asymmetry between fold-left and fold-right (5 minutes)
   - ticket 170
   - Will says procedure arguments should come first

10. rename named let? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 165

11. Syntactic datums and datum values (5 minutes)
   - ticket 209

12. get-bytevector-some may be difficult to implement (5 minutes)
   - ticket 224

13. Raising of exceptions should not be ambiguous or confusing (5 minutes)
   - ticket 176
   - Will says the response defends early arity checks

14. adjourn
