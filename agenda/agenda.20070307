   - ticket 148
   - see also ticket 182

?. add input/output-port?, string-port?, bytevector-port? predicates?
   - ticket 182
   - input/output port can be defined by the user; is it worth adding?

?. what should (sqrt -0.0) return?
   - ticket 141 quotes IEEE-754R draft that squareRoot(-0) should be -0
   - therefore suggests (flsqrt -0.0) should be -0.0
   - what about (sqrt -0.0)?

?. adjourn
