0. finalize agenda (1 minute)

1. action items (1 minute)
   - for each ticket 135 and 137+, enter proposed response into
     ticket-*.txt and set trac status to one of:
       blocker (red) = "don't know" but should should be easy
       critical (yellow) = done, probably uncontroversial
       major (white) = suggested response/action, but needs discussion
       minor (cyan) = we have to discuss it, first
       trivial (blue) = I'm stumped for the moment
     (All)
   - record response votes (All)
   - draft responses for ticket numbers 138, 145, 150, 151, 153,
     159, 160, 161, 164, 165, 166, 168, 169, 172, 174, 184, 189,
     190, 191, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 200

2. what should (sqrt -0.0) return? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 141 quotes IEEE-754R draft that squareRoot(-0) should be -0
   - therefore suggests (flsqrt -0.0) should be -0.0
   - what about (sqrt -0.0)?

3. allow unstable vector-sort! with worst-case o(n^2) behavior? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 142

4. add textual-port?, input/output-port? predicates? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 182

5. keep last-minute 5.92 change to string and bytevector output ports?
   add string-port?, bytevector-port? predicates? (10 minutes)
   - tickets 148 and 182

6. revisit unspecified value and mrvs semantics? (5-15 minutes)
   - see ticket 152 response
   - question for us to vote upon: should we reopen these issues?
   - if we vote "yes" we can spend some time discussing the issues;
     otherwise, ticket-152 response is "comment withdrawn by submitter".
   - this also affects ticket 156

7. replace return of unspecified value with return of unspecified number
   of unspecified values? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 152

8. allow the empty list, vectors, and bytevectors to be self-evaluating?
   (5 minutes)

9. floor, ceiling, truncate, and round raise an exception or abort on
   infinity and NaN arguments? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 167

10. Add native-transcoder, drop binary transcoders, and for missing
   transcoder open-file-*-port argument return a binary port? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 180

11. standard-x-port return fresh binary ports? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 183

12. add buffer modes to open-file-input-port? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 186
   - do we allow peeking on unbuffered input port?

13. add boolean=? and symbol=? predicates? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 188
