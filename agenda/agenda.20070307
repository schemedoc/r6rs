0. finalize agenda (1 minute)

1. action items (1 minute)
   - for each ticket 135 and 137+, enter proposed response into
     ticket-*.txt and set trac status to one of:
       blocker (red) = "don't know" but should should be easy
       critical (yellow) = done, probably uncontroversial
       major (white) = suggested response/action, but needs discussion
       minor (cyan) = we have to discuss it, first
       trivial (blue) = I'm stumped for the moment
     (All)
   - record response votes (All)
   - draft responses for ticket numbers 145, 166, 184, 189, 193, 194,
     195, 196, 198
   - need final resolution in responses for ticket numbers 150, 164

2. what should (sqrt -0.0) return? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 141 quotes IEEE-754R draft that squareRoot(-0) should be -0
   - therefore suggests (flsqrt -0.0) should be -0.0
   - what about (sqrt -0.0)?

3. allow unstable vector-sort! with worst-case o(n^2) behavior? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 142

4. add textual-port?, input/output-port? predicates? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 182

5. keep last-minute 5.92 change to string and bytevector output ports?
   add string-port?, bytevector-port? predicates? (10 minutes)
   - tickets 148 and 182

6. revisit unspecified value and mrvs semantics? (5-15 minutes)
   - see ticket 152 response
   - question for us to vote upon: should we reopen these issues?
   - if we vote "yes" we can spend some time discussing the issues;
     otherwise, ticket-152 response is "comment withdrawn by submitter".
   - this also affects ticket 156

7. replace return of unspecified value with return of unspecified number
   of unspecified values? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 152

8. allow the empty list, vectors, and bytevectors to be self-evaluating?
   (5 minutes)
   - ticket 154

9. floor, ceiling, truncate, and round raise an exception or abort on
   infinity and NaN arguments? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 167

10. Add native-transcoder, drop binary transcoders, and for missing
   transcoder open-file-*-port argument return a binary port? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 180

11. standard-x-port return fresh binary ports? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 183

12. add buffer modes to open-file-input-port? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 186
   - do we allow peeking on unbuffered input port?

13. add boolean=? and symbol=? predicates? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 188

14. allow (case-lambda)? (5 minutes)
    - see https://r6rs.scheming.org/node/580
