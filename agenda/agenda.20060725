0. finalize agenda (1 minute)

1. action items from 7/20/2006 (5 minutes)
   - post revised library syntax w/export default phase (Kent)
   - update (again) reference implementation for arithmetic SRFI (Will)
   - carried over:
     - update library srfi (Matthew and Kent)
       (pending syntax/phasing decisions)
     - complete unicode reference implementation (Will)
     - comment on core/library split (All)

2. set-car! and set-cdr! (10 minutes)
   - vote between options:
     - flush entirely
     - relegate to r5rs compatibility library
     - place in own "mutable list" library
     - leave in the core

3. library syntax (5 minutes)
   - vote to accept essentially as currently proposed
   - see https://r6rs.scheming.org/node/303#comment-1621
   - vote on options:
     - definitions before expressions in lambda bodies
     - definitions before expressions in library bodies

4. library phasing (10 minutes)
   - two options on the table:
     Model 1: library invoked once per run
      - simpler, easier to implement
      - can lead to accidental sharing of library state between
        compilation and run time of a library
      - works with current library syntax and eval specification
     Model 2: library invoked once per phase
      - more complex, harder to implement
      - prevents accidental sharing of library state between compilation
        and run time of a library
      - requires a richer import-phase specification and some eval
        exprssion syntax for specifying import phases
   - see https://r6rs.scheming.org/node/307

5. safe/unsafe mode (5 minutes)
   - vote between Proposals 0, 1, 2, and 3
   - see draft/safety/safety.txt, draft/safety/safety2.txt
   - see also extensive email discussion

6. I/O (10 minutes)
   - continued discussion
