   - no decision yet

   + response does not yet reflect technical decision made:
     26, 36, 41, 42, 48: should reflect decision to defer until 1/15
     87: should be softened to "attempt to address concerns"
     117: should reflect decision to reject allow bodies more widely
     130: needs to say multiple versions of a library remain prohibited

   & questions/comments:
     35: can we list as withdrawn?
     96: response may need to be updated to reflect response to 78
     117: response should either not mention declarations or
          mention that they have been flushed

   * came in after 11/15; no response necessary

2. rationalize various iteration procedures
   - ticket 78

3. syntax-rules issues
   - tickets 111: syntax-rules should evaluate to a transformer
   - tickets 114: identifier macros with syntax-rules
   - summary of proposed response:
     - make syntax-rules evaluate to a transformer
     - allow _ (unparenthesized) pattern for syntax-rules
     - add make-variable-transformer to base library
     - add identifier-syntax to base library
     - base library exports only three things for expand: syntax-rules,
       make-variable-transformer, and identifier-syntax
   - alternative response:
     - make syntax-rules evaluate to a transformer
     - add identifier-syntax to base library
     - base library exports only two things for expand: syntax-rules
       and identifier-syntax

4. add negative meta levels?
   - ticket 109

5. add "lazy" procedure?  retain (r6rs promises) library?
   - ticket 7

6. add file-exists? and delete-file
   - ticket 124

7. add "parent-descriptors" clause?
   - ticket 90

8. provide UTF-16 codec?
   - ticket 68

9. add lib syntax?
   - ticket 86

10. rename bytes to ???
   - ticket 99

11. add "...-vector->bytes" and "...-bytes->vector" procedures?
   - ticket 115

12. allow set!, etc., to return unspecified number of unspecified values
   - ticket 118

13. add ->single and ->double
   - ticket 122
   - perhaps as number->single, number->double
     (then should ->exact become number->exact and ->inexact become
      number->inexact?)

14. allow (nongenerative #t)
   - ticket 129
   - or (nongenerative)
     (then should (sealed #t) change to (sealed) and (opaque #t) change
      to (opaque)?)

15. allow (define-record-type point (fields x y)) abbreviation
   - ticket 132

16. allow string exit codes
   - ticket 18
   - how is this affected by script -> program change?

17. allow additional line terminators?
   - ticket 46

18. allow #<n>(---) vector syntax?
   - ticket 59

19. change "find" to raise exception when returned element would have been #f?
