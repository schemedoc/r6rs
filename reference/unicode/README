This directory contains a reference implementation for (r6rs unicode).
It consists of the following files:

    README              what you're reading
    unicode.sch         the (r6rs unicode) library
    unicode1.sch        definitions of all but the normalization procedures
    unicode2.sch        definitions of the four normalization procedures
    unicode-tests.sch   basic tests (not including normalization)
    check-normalization.scm   tests of normalization
    parseUCD.sch        almost-R5RS code to generate the tables
                            in unicode1.sch and unicode2.sch

The reference implementation should be compatible with
Unicode revision 5.0.0.  To change the tables to support
a more recent version of Unicode, see parseUCD.sch.

For license information, see the copyright files at the top
of each file.

This implementation is written in R6RS Scheme, but has been
tested only in a pre-R6RS version of Larceny.

                                * * *

Enjoy!
