This directory contains a reference implementation for (r6rs bytes).
It consists of the following files:

    README              what you're reading
    bytes.sch           the (r6rs bytes) library
    bytes-core.sch      definitions of the core procedures
    bytes-proto.sch     definitions of most other procedures
    bytes-ieee.sch      definitions related to IEEE-754
    bytes-tests.sch     tests
    r5rs.sch            for testing in R5RS-compatible systems

For license information, see the copyright files at the top
of each file.

This implementation is written in R6RS Scheme with a few exceptions:

- bytes-tests.sch and r5rs.sch are written in R5RS Scheme.

- bytes-core.sch contains system-specific definitions that
  implementors of the R6RS are expected to rewrite.

For improved efficiency, most implementors will also want to
rewrite at least some of the definitions in bytes-proto.sch
and in bytes-ieee.sch.

                                * * *

To load the code into an R5RS-conforming system:

1.  (load "r5rs.sch")

This will run a series of tests after the code is loaded.
Exactly one test should fail (because bytes objects will
be represented as vectors).

                                * * *

Enjoy!
