;; This layer:
;;  Does need to support inheritance
;;  Doesn't need to support immutability (but immutability 
;;   information is provided in case it's useful)
;;  Does need to enforce types at selectors and arity for the
;;   constructor
;;  Does need to implement generativity
;;  Does not need to implement opacity for inspection purposes,
;;   but does need to implement any sort of opacaity with respect
;;   to non-R6RS features that the implementation would like
;;   to provide (since generativity covers opacity within the
;;   bounds of R6RS); opacity is implemented here via an imported
;;   library of opaque cells
