This directory contains a reference implementation for
(r6rs bytevector), or whatever the name of that library
is this week.  It contains the following files:

    README                      what you're reading
    bytevector.sch              the (r6rs bytevector) library
    bvec-core.sch               definitions of the core procedures
    bvec-proto.sch              definitions of most other procedures
    bvec-ieee.sch               definitions related to IEEE-754
    bvec-string.sch             string <-> bytevector conversions
    bytevector-tests.sch        tests
    bytevector-tests-r5rs.sch   tests used by r5rs.sch
    r5rs.sch                    for testing in R5RS-compatible systems
    larceny.sch                 for testing Larceny v0.94

For license information, see the copyright files at the top
of each file.

This implementation is written in R6RS Scheme with a few exceptions:

- r5rs.sch is written in R5RS Scheme.

- bytevector-tests-r5rs.sch is written in R5RS Scheme,
  but the tests of string <-> bytevector conversion
  assume that all Unicode characters are supported
  and can appear in strings.

- bvec-core.sch contains system-specific definitions that
  implementors of the R6RS are expected to rewrite.

For improved efficiency, most implementors will also want to
rewrite at least some of the definitions in bvec-proto.sch
and in bvec-ieee.sch.

                                * * *

To load the code into an R5RS-conforming system:

1.  (load "r5rs.sch")

This will run a series of tests after the code is loaded.
Exactly one test should fail (because bytevectors will be
represented as vectors).  If the system does not support
Unicode characters and strings, then the conversion tests
will also fail, but they are run last.  The exhaustive
tests of string conversion may take a long time.

                                * * *

To run the tests in Larceny v0.94:

1.  (load "larceny.sch")

This will run a series of tests after the code is loaded.

                                * * *

Enjoy!
