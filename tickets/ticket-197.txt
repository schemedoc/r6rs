I/O: `call-with-port' and multiple returns
Reported by: 	Ludovic Courtès
Version: 	5.92

Section 7.2.6 of the [Libraries] manual does not explicitly mention
how `call-with-port' should behave if PROC returns multiple times. For
instance, is the following a valid implementation of `call-with-port'?

  (define (call-with-port port proc)
    (dynamic-wind
        (lambda ()
          #t)
        (lambda ()
          (proc port))
        (lambda ()
          (close-port port))))

If it is, I would suggest adding a few words saying that once the
dynamic extent of PROC has been left, PORT is closed even if it is
eventually re-entered.


RESPONSE:

The wording actually does say "if port returns", which is independent
of whether the context is ever re-entered.
