should allow quoting non-letters in identifiers

Summary: allow escaping non-constituent characters in identifiers

Common Lisp and many Scheme implementations provide a way to escape
certain characters to force them to be viewed as constituents of
identifiers (and hence symbols).

The draft does allow <inline hex escape> to serve this need, but such
hex escapes are not very readable or user-friendly.

Traditionally, one or both of these have been used:

|123|
\123

We may not want to reserve | for this purpose, but \ is already in use
for escapes, and it is easy to extend it. I suggest:

<initial> --> <constituent> | <special initial>
   | <inline escape>

<inline escape> -->
   | <inline hex escape>
   | \<character name>;
   | \<any character whose category is none of Lu, Ll, Lt, Lm, or Lo>
