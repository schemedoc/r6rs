Declarations do not belong in the report

One sentence summary: Declarations have no reliable semantics and
should be dropped from the report.

Description: 

A big problem with declarations is that the way they're specified,
they do not follow any scoping rules. This is especially true in the
presence of macros: when one library with one declaration exports a
macro that is used in another library using a different set of
declarations. There is just no meaningful way in which the programmer
can specify the extent of a declaration or know how a single
declaration in one library is going to affect the rest of the program.

Another problem with declarations is that they are very very
implementation specific. The current set declarations may be useless
for some implementations, while other implementations may need a
different set. There is no one-size-fits-all set.

There is no way in which one can use declarations reliably, safely,
and in a portable way. The original goal of R6RS was portability and
code sharing. Declarations, as they stand in the report, do not help
accomplishing that goal and may indeed hinder it.

Recommendation: 

Implementation-specific features (including declarations) should be
implemented as implementation-specific libraries and not be mandated
by the report.
