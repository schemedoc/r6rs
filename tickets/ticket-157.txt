Allow limited comparisons of complex numbers
Reported by: 	John Cowan
Version:	5.92

Summary: Some general complex inequality comparisons should be
allowed.

Currently, general complex numbers cannot be compared with <, >, <=,
or >=: the concept is mathematically defined. However, certain kinds
of restricted complex numbers can be compared. The status quo is to
permit comparison of real numbers only.

Option A: extend these functions to compare imaginary numbers (real
part zero in the sense of "zero?").

Option B: extend these functions to compare general complex numbers
provided that all the real-parts are the same or all the
imaginary-parts are the same.

In either case, an error should be signaled if the numbers don't meet
the criteria.

This allows looping along any orthogonal line in the complex plane
using >= rather than = to terminate; with inexact numbers, < is more
reliable.
