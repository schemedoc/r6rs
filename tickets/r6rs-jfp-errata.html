	<dd>The sentence 
	<p>"An object fetched from a location, by a variable reference or by
	  a procedure such as <code>car</code>,
	  <code>vector-ref</code>, or <code>string-ref</code>, is
	  equivalent in the sense of <code>eqv?</code>
	  (section 11.5)
	  to the object last stored in the location before the
	  fetch."</p>
	<p>should be amended by:</p>
	<p>", except
	  when that object is a procedure.  When the object is a procedure, the
	  object fetched from the location will also be a procedure that behaves
	  identically to the procedure last stored in the location, but it is
	  possible that it is not the same object."
	  </p>
	</dd>
      <dt>&sect; 11.4.5</dt>
      <dd>The first example for <code>case</code> is slightly
	confusing, as it suggests that 1 is a composite number: It
	should be elided from the second branch of the <code>case</code>.</dd>
      <dt>&sect; 11.5</dt>
      <dd>In the definition of the behavior of <code>eqv?</code> on
	inexact numbers - both <code>#t</code> and <code>#f</code>
	cases - the phrase
	<p>"	[...] as a finite composition of Scheme's standard arithmetic
	  procedures."</p>
	<p>should be augmented by:</p>
	<p>", as long as the evaluation of that application does not
	  involve NaN."</p>
	</dd>
      <dd>The following sentence should be elided:
	<p>"Furthermore, a constant may be copied at any time by the implementation so
	  as to exist simultaneously in different sets of locations, as noted in
	  section 11.4.1."
	</p>
      </dd>
      <dd>The following example for <code>eq?</code>
	<pre>(eq? car car) =&gt; #t</pre>
	should be replaced by
	<pre>(eq? car car) =&gt; <i>unspecified</i></pre>
      </dd>
      <dt>&sect; 11.6</dt>
      <dd>In the entry for <code>list-ref</code>,
	"<code>list-tail</code>" should be replaced by
	"<code>list-ref</code>".</dd>
      <dd>The note for <code>string-&gt;number</code> should be replaced
      by:
	<p>
	  "If the arguments to <code>string-&gt;number</code> are a
	  string and a valid radix as specified, it must produce a
	  number object or <code>#f</code> ; it may not raise an
	  exception."
	<p>
	  (I.e., <code>string-&gt;number</code> may raise an exception
	  if the argument is not a string.)
	</p>
	</dd>
       <dt>&sect; 11.9<dt>
      <dd><p>The sentence at the end of the entry for <code>append</code>
      should be clarified to:</p>
	<p>"The return value is made from new pairs for all arguments but the
	  last; the last is merely placed at the end of the new structure."</p>

    <dl>
    <dt>&sect; 11.2</dt>
    <dd>In the code specifying the computation for
	<code>fxbit-count</code>, "<var>ei</var>" should be "<var>fx</var>".</dd>
    <dd>In the code specifying the computation for
	<code>fxbit-set?</code>, <code>fx&gt;=</code> should be <code>fx&gt;=?</code>.</dd>
    <dt>&sect; 12.1</dt>
    <dd>The remark "An algebra that defines how marks and substitutions work more
      precisely is given in section~2.4 of Oscar Waddell's PhD
      thesis." is somewhat misleading and should be qualified as
      follows:
      
      <p>"Note, however, that Waddell's
	thesis describes slightly different semantics for 
	<code>bound-identifier=?</code> - it specifies that for two identifiers to be
	equal in the sense of <code>bound-identifier=?</code>, they must have the same marks and be equal in
	the sense of <code>free-identifier=?</code>, whereas this report requires
	instead that they must have the same marks and have the same name."</p>
    </dd>
      <dt>&sect; 12.6</dt>
      <dd>The example definition of the <code>include</code> macro
      uses
	<pre>(open-file-input-port fn)</pre>
	to open the file, which would result in a binary input port.
	Instead, a textual input port should be opened, for example via:
	<pre>(open-file-input-port fn (file-options) (buffer-mode block) (native-transcoder))</pre>
      </dd>
      <dt>&sect; 14</dt>
      <dd>There's an extra parenthesis at the end of the code example
	for <code>enum-set-projection</code>.</dd>
