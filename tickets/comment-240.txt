Subject: [Formal] Lexemes #vu8( #' #` #, #,@ missing
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0704240013520.15546@smaug.linux.pwf.cam.ac.uk>

type: Defect
priority: Minor
component: Lexical Syntax
version: 5.92
summary: Lexemes #vu8( #' #` #, #,@ missing

Section 3 (page 11) suggests that the read syntax converts a stream
of characters into a stream of lexemes, and that the read syntax
then operates on this stream of lexemes.  There are, however,
sequences of characters that are recognised by the read syntax
(page 16) but not by the lexical syntax (page 12), namely "#vu8(",
"#'", "#`", "#,", and "#,@".

The obvious correction is to add these sequences to the production of
<lexeme>.
