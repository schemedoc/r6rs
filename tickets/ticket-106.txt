Ticket #106 (defect)

"#! /usr/bin/env" is not "portable." It's Unix-specific.
Status: new	Reported by:	Arthur A. Gleckler	Assigned to:	anton
Priority:	major	Milestone:	r6rs
Component:	scripts	Version:	5.91

In <7.1. Script syntax> and <7.1.1. Script header>, I am appalled that
we're considering putting such a completely Unix-specific feature in
what is supposed to be a portable specification for the language. This
belongs in an SRFI targeted at Unix systems, not in the language
spec. Analogous SRFIs could address the same issue for code running on
Windows and running on other operating systems. At the very least,
this feature should come with a caveat saying that only Unix-based
implementations are required to support this syntax, but that would
still be a terrible compromise.
