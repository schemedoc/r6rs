Formal comment #218 (defect)

5.1. Requirement levels is MAXxed out
Reported by: 	Aubrey Jaffer
Version: 	5.92

On page 20 "5.1. Requirement levels", the two occurences of the word
"max" should be replaced by "may" (marked with below):

5.1. Requirement levels

The key words "must", "must not", "required", "shall", "shall not",
"should", "should not", "recommended", "may", and "optional" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4].
Specifically:

  must
	This word means that a statement is an absolute requirement of
    the specification.

  must not
	This phrase means that a statement is an absolute prohibition
    of the specification.

  should
	This word, or the adjective "recommended", mean that valid
    reasons max exist in particular circumstances to ignore a
 -----------^^^
    statement, but that the implications must be understood and
    weighed before choosing a di=EF=AC=80erent course.

  should not
	This phrase, or the phrase "not recommended", mean that valid
    reasons max exist in particular circumstances when the behavior of
 -----------^^^
    a statement is acceptable, but that the implications must be
    understood and weighed before choosing the course described by the
    statement.

  may
	This word, or the adjective "optional", mean that an item is
    truly optional.


RESPONSE:

This will be fixed in the next draft.
