Summary

A small but significantly useful enhancement to the conciseness of the
most common case in the implicit naming record definition layer is
requested.

Description

There have been many complaints regarding the verbosity of the records
proposal. Therefore, please allow the further abbreviation:

   <field-spec> ::= <identifier>

for (immutable <identifier>). This would make the most common case of
record definition to be significant more concise. For example,

   (define-record-type point (fields x y))

which competes well with many common conventions. The immutable case
should be the shorter form.
