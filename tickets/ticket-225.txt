Formal comment #225 (defect)

need make-custom-textual-input-port and make-custom-textual-output-port
Reported by: 	Per Bothner

The procedures make-custom-binary-input-port and
make-custom-binary-output-port allow one to create custom binary
ports. However, there seems to be no way to create similar textual
ports. I guess in theory one might be able to wrap a transcoder around
a custom binary port but that seems horribly wrong when there is no
underlying byte stream.

Specifically, it should be possible to implement
open-string-input-port and open-string-output-port using purely public
procedures.

Furthermore, open-string-input-port should return a seekable port. See
my other comment. 'allow port position to be "magic cookie"'
