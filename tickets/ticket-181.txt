Formal comment #181 (simplification)

utf-32-codec is useless
Reported by: 	John Cowan
Version:	5.92

Summary: utf-32-codec is unnecessary

UTF-32 is not used to any significant degree externally to a process,
and though it is trivial to define, it does not have any warrant for
standardization. The requirement for providing a codec for it via the
utf-32-codec procedure should be removed.

RESPONSE:

The UTF-32 codec will be removed in the next draft of the report.
