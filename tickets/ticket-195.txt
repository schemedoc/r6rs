procedures passed to make-hash-table should not mutate the hash table
Reported by: 	Daniel Villeneuve
Version: 	5.92

SUMMARY

The callback functions passed to make-hash-table should not mutate the
hash table they're invoked on.

DESCRIPTION

I think this is evident, though it is not clearly stated in the spec
(p. 51, Constructors).

PROPOSAL

Add "The <hash-function> and <equiv> procedures must not mutate the
hash-table they are invoked on.", similar to the spec of map.
