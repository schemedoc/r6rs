Formal comment #195 (enhancement)

procedures passed to make-hash-table should not mutate the hash table
Reported by: 	Daniel Villeneuve
Version: 	5.92

SUMMARY

The callback functions passed to make-hash-table should not mutate the
hash table they're invoked on.

DESCRIPTION

I think this is evident, though it is not clearly stated in the spec
(p. 51, Constructors).

PROPOSAL

Add "The <hash-function> and <equiv> procedures must not mutate the
hash-table they are invoked on.", similar to the spec of map.


RESPONSE:

Arguably, the requirement stated in version 5.92 that <hash-function> 
and <equiv> "should behave like pure functions on the domain of keys" 
covers this case.  However, to eliminate any ambiguity, in the next 
draft of the Report, language will be added to the effect that the 
procedures in question should not mutate the hashtable.
