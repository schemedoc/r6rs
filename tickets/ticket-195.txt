Formal comment #195 (enhancement)

procedures passed to make-hash-table should not mutate the hash table
Reported by: 	Daniel Villeneuve
Version: 	5.92

SUMMARY

The callback functions passed to make-hash-table should not mutate the
hash table they're invoked on.

DESCRIPTION

I think this is evident, though it is not clearly stated in the spec
(p. 51, Constructors).

PROPOSAL

Add "The <hash-function> and <equiv> procedures must not mutate the
hash-table they are invoked on.", similar to the spec of map.


RESPONSE

Arguably, the requirement stated in version 5.92 that <hash-function> 
and <equiv> "should behave like pure functions on the domain of keys" 
covers this case.  However, to eliminate any ambiguity, the proposal 
will be adopted in the next draft of the Report.
