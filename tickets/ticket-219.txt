Formal comment #219 (defect)

the procedural record layer needs better examples
Reported by: 	Per Bothner
Version: 	5.92

I'm trying to "grok" the "protocol" of the procedural record layer,
and it's a bit heavy for most people, including myself. Now the R6RS
is not meant to be tutorial, but it does have examples, and this is a
place where examples are important.

There is an :point and :point2 example at the end of the section, but
it doesn't show any non-trivial use of record-constructor. Perhaps use
case-lambda to allow defaulting the arguments to zero?

There are some examples of defining a non-trivial protocol in the
Explicit-naming section. At the very least
make-record-constructor-descriptor should have a forward reference to
these examples.

Also, the point3 example at the end of section 5.2 is a little
confusing, since it is a 2-dimensional point, not 3.

RESPONSE:

The editors will make an effort to improve the presentation.
