Rather than introducing novel "forall" and "exists" procedures, the
"any" and "every" procedures of SRFI-1 should be adopted, along with
the language of SRFI-1 describing them. SRFI-1 is a very successful
list library and should be used as the basis for selective inclusion
of new list-related features in R6RS.
