Ticket #4 (simplification)

Scheme and Common Lisp are not the only statically-scoped Lisp dialects

4.2, third paragraph, page 16, states the following: "Like Algol and
Pascal, and unlike most other dialects of Lisp except for Common Lisp,
Scheme is a statically scoped language with block structure."

It was indeed the case that when this sentence was originally written
that Scheme and Common Lisp were almost the only dialects with static
scoping. However, this situation has changed by now. There have been
quite a few statically scoped Lisp dialects since then (EuLisp?,
Dylan, ISLISP, to name a few).

Suggestion: Drop the first part of the sentence, keeping only this:
"Scheme is a statically scoped language with block structure."

RESPONSE:

The suggestion will be adopted in the next draft of the report.
