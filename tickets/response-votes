Response votes:

For each formal comment, vote to accept the response by placing the
letter "A" after the colon after your name, e.g.:

  Kent   : A

You may withdraw your acceptance by deleting the date after your name.

You are responsible for removing your acceptance if you disapprove with
any change made to a ticket response after you vote.  I suggest you
cache a copy of the response at the time of your vote and run "diff"
periodically to make sure that no changes of which you disapprove have
been made to any ticket you have accepted.

An editor who changes the text of a response is not required to notify
other editors who have already accepted the response, but if the change is
major, it might be a good idea do do so.
