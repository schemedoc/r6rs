Ticket #90 (simplification)

Record layers are not orthogonal
Status: new	Reported by:	William D Clinger	Assigned to:	sperber
Priority:	minor	Milestone:	r6rs
Component:	records	Version:	5.91

The procedural record layer (r6rs records procedural) is strictly more
expressive than the syntactic layers, (r6rs records explicit) and
(r6rs records implicit), because the procedural layer can create new
subtypes given only a record-type-descriptor, but the two syntactic
layers cannot.

This is entirely appropriate, assuming the syntactic layers are
provided only for convenience in simple cases, and the procedural
layer is intended to be used for all complex cases.

Assuming that assumption, however, the two syntactic layers could be
simplified further. Since they are not intended to be fully general,
they ought to be made easier to use for simple cases.

Although simplification of the syntactic layers is one solution to
this problem, I would suggest a more radical solution: omit both
syntactic layers from the R6RS. Both could be described by a SRFI and
provided by portable reference implementations that build on the
procedural layer.

Omitting the syntactic layers from the report would have the added
benefit of permitting other syntactic alternatives on an equal footing
with those described in the draft R6RS. No portability would be lost;
the procedural layer would be the only universal record layer, just as
in the draft R6RS.
