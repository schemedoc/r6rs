Formal comment #216 (defect)

Capitalize "Boolean."
Reported by: 	Arthur A. Gleckler
Version: 	5.92

In <4.6 Boolean values> and throughout, capitalize "Boolean" when
referring to that data type in English text. Java's capitalization-
based distinction between the primitive and non-primitive names for
that type, among other things, has made it easy to forget that Boolean
is named after a person, and is therefore a proper noun.


RESPONSE:

The word is usually capitalized when used as an adjective,
e.g. Boolean logic, but not so much when used as a noun, and
especially not when used as the name of a data type in a programming
language unless the language capitalizes the names of all (or all
basic) types.  See e.g.

Therefore the formal comment's suggestion will not be adopted.
