Formal comment #131 (enhancement)

separator spaces in dislay/write output
Reported by:	Per Bothner
Priority:	minor
Milestone:	r6rs
Component:	i/o
Version:	5.91

The report is not very precise about required or permitted formatting
of the values written using display or write. I'm specifically
concerned about whether an implementation is allowed or required to
write out spaces between datums.

Consider: 

(write 3) (write 4) The traditional output is "34". However, the
traditional expectation is that output from write can be read back
using read (with various exceptions we won't go into here). Obviously,
the "34" cannot be read back to yield 3 and 4. The solution is to
insert a space, so the output becomes "3 4".

Similarly: 

(display 3) (display 4) also yields the traditional output
"34". Again, the traditional expectation is that output from display
should be "human-readable" and reasonably nicely formatted. Again, the
traditional output fails in this respect.

To avoid these problems people can and do insert explicit spaces, for
example using (dwrite-char #\space). But this low-level formatting
shouldn't be needed; it is especially annoying in loops, where one has
to explicitly test if this is the first iteration of the loop, and
only display a space when it is not. It's even harder with more
complicated loops or recursion.

Suggestion: Allow (require?) an implementation to insert spaces in
these cases. I will describe this operationally, in terms of what an
implementation might do; this is probably not how it should be
formulated in R6RS.

Each text output port has a datum-written bit, which is initially
false. The functions write-char and newline ignore and clear the
datum-written bit. The function write always writes an initial space
if the datum-written flag was set, and sets the datum-written flag
when done. The behavior of display depends on the type of the value:
If the value is a string or character, then display ignores and clears
the datum-written bit, just like write-char. Otherwise, display acts
like write, in that it writes an initial space if the datum-written
flag was set, and sets the datum-written flag when done.

This rule is simple to describe, to implement, and seems to "do the
right thing" quite consistently. It is easy to suppress the extra
spaces in the rare case when that is wanted, for example by using
(display ""). Suppressing the extra case happens automatically
whenever explicit formatting is done, such as by displaying a string
between two displayed values.

I believe there will be rare in practice for a real program to print
different output under this rule than in traditional implementations,
and it's even harder to think of cases where the latter output is more
desirable or correct.

I have implemented this for Kawa, and it works quite nicely. However,
there is legitimate concern about compatibility: first whether any
actual code would break, and secondly whether this is allowed by R5RS
and/or R5RS. I'm requesting that if R6RS does not require the
described behavior it at least not prohibit it.

RESPONSE:

The 5.91 draft contains a special note addressing this question:

  The put-datum procedure merely writes the external
  representation.  If put-datum is used to write several
  subsequent external representations to an output port, care must be
  taken to delimit them properly so they can be read back in by
  subsequent calls to get-datum.

As the description of `put-datum' says nothing about a trailing
delimiter, and a trailing delimiter is also not part of the external
representation of a datum value, the report is indeed precise:
No trailing delimiter may be present in the output of `put-datum'.
The editors will attempt to make the wording clearer in a future
revision of the report.

Prohibiting a trailing delimiter was an intentional decision: Changing
the specification to sometimes output a delimiter would make the
description more complex, and programs using (output-string "") or an
equivalent call harder to read.  On the other hand, explicit code to
output the delimiter is easy to write and read.
