Message-ID: <20070605201641.GJ18038@mercury.ccil.org>

Submitter: John Cowan
Email address: cowan at ccil.org
Issue type: Defect
Priority: Minor
Component:  Port I/O
Report version: 5.93
Summary: make-custom-textual-input/output-port procedure missing.

This is justified by the existence of make-custom-binary-input/output-port
on the one hand, and make-custom-textual-input-port and
make-custom-textual-output-port on the other.
