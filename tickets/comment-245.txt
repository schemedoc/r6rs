Subject: [Formal] number->string and put-datum have different restrictions
 for inexact arguments

Submitter: Alan Watson
Issue type: Enhancement
Priority: Minor
Component: Base Library Chapter 9 and Library Chapter 8
Version: 5.93

Summary:

When number->string is used on an inexact number and the radix is 10, it 
is required to produce the minimum number of mantissa digits that 
satisfy eqv? invariance with string->number. However, put-datum does not 
have any similar restriction on the number of mantissa digits.

I would suggest that the behaviour of these two procedures be made more 
similar (i.e, apply the minimum digits requirement to put-datum or drop 
the minimum digits requirement on number->string) or a note be added to 
explain why they are different.


RESPONSE:

The pertinent aspect of this is the `put-datum'/`get-datum' invariance
with respect to `equal?'.  A specification of this invariance has been
added.
