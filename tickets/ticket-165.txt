Formal comment #165 (defect)

Rename named `let'
Reported by: 	Mike Sperber
Version:	5.92

Issue

The fact that the convenient syntax for writing recursive procedures
is part of `let' is a long-standing wart in the syntax of Scheme. It
is unintuitive (it expands into `letrec', rather than a simpler form
of `let), difficult to explain to newcomers to Scheme, and
disconcerting to the casual reader.

How to fix

If the syntax needs to be integrated with one of the standard binding
forms, it should be letrec', not let'. However, it would be much
better to rename named let' to something else such as rec', `recur' or
`recursive'.

As this would break many existing Scheme programs, the report might
introduce the separate form, and, to ease the transition, keep named
`let' for now, either putting it into a separate library alongside
(r6rs mutable-pairs) or at least marking it as deprecated and likely
to disappear in a future revision of the report.
