Ticket #89 (simplification)

Leave readers and writers out of the report
Status: new	Reported by:	William D Clinger	Assigned to:	sperber
Priority:	major	Milestone:	r6rs
Component:	i/o	Version:	5.91

Section 15.2 of the draft R6RS specifies reader and writer objects,
which represent arbitrary sources and sinks for binary data. These
objects are not used anywhere else in the report, do not appear to
have been used in the field, and well-known principles of software
reuse would argue for making them ports instead of a separate data
type.

So long as they are a separate data type, however, they could be
specified by a SRFI and implemented by a portable reference
implementation. It appears that no significant efficiency would be
lost by providing them via a portable reference implementation, since
the operations on file readers and writers could just delegate to an
encapsulated binary port.

If they were ports, they might be useful. Including them in the R6RS
as a separate data type might interfere with making them ports in the
R7RS.
