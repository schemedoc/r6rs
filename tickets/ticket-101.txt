Formal comment #101 (defect)

Phrasing in 14. Exceptions and conditions is unclear
Reported by:	Arthur A. Gleckler
Priority:	minor
Milestone:	r6rs
Component:	exceptions
Version:	5.91

In <14. Exceptions and conditions>, the only paragraph reads: 

Scheme allows programs to deal with exceptional situations using two
cooperating facilities: The exception system allows the program, when
it detects an exceptional situation, to pass control to an exception
handler, and for dynamically establishing such exception
handlers. Exception handlers are always invoked with an object
describing the exceptional situation. Scheme's condition system
provides a standardized taxonomy of such descriptive objects, as well
as facility for defining new condition types.

But this makes it unclear what the two facilities are, exceptions and
handlers or exceptions and conditions. Rephrase.

RESPONSE:

This will be fixed in the next draft of the report.
