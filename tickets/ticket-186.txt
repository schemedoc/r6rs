Formal comment #186 (defect)

Buffer mode should be specifiable on open-file-input-port
Reported by: 	John Cowan
Version:	5.92

Currently, buffer modes are for output only. However, operating
systems also distinguish between buffered and unbuffered input. The
open-file-input-port procedure should be allowed to accept an
additional argument specifying the buffer mode, in parallel with
open-file-output-port. Allowing input to be unbuffered can limit
deadlocks when dealing with communicating processes.
