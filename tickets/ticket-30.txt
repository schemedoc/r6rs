Formal comment #30 (defect)

The definition of standard-{output,error} port speaks of input
Reported by:	John Cowan
Priority:	trivial
Component:	i/o
Version:	5.91

The phrase is "If the returned port supports textual input"; it should
be "textual output".

RESPONSE:

This will be fixed in the next draft of the report.
