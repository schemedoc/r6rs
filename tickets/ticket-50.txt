Summary

"inexact-make-rectangular" was written where "inexact-make-polar" was
apparently intended.

Description

At the end of section 16, on page 107, after
inexact-make-rectangular's behavior is demonstrated, there follows an
example with the obvious polar coordinates, but passed to
inexact-make-rectangular again rather than inexact-make-polar.

RESPONSE:

The inexact-arithmetic library will be deleted in the next revision of
the report; hence, the formal comment will not apply anymore.
