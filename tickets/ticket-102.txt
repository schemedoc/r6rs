Formal comment #102 (defect)

inconsistent punctuation
Reported by:	Arthur A. Gleckler
Priority:	trivial
Milestone:	r6rs
Component:	other
Version:	5.91

Some parts of the report put punctuation inside quotes
(e.g. '"quote,",' which is correct) and other parts put it outside
quotes (e.g. the incorrect '"quote",'). For example, see <5.1. Entry
format> and search for:

"procedure", 

and: 

"procedure," 

Both appear, in different paragraphs. We should be consistent.

RESPONSE:

The "outside quotes" convention will be adopted in the next draft of
the report.
