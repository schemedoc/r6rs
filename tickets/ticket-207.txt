Formal comment #207 (defect)

combine syntactic record layers
Reported by: 	Kent Dybvig
Version: 	5.92

Having two syntactic record libraries in the report gives the
appearance of language bloat without added expressiveness, since the
explicit-naming layer is a strict subset of the implicit-naming layer.

An equivalent of the (r6rs records explicit) library can be defined as
a wrapper for the (r6rs records implicit) library, perhaps as a SRFI
that can be used when programmers wish to be sure that no names are
being generated implicitly.

Proposal:

Eliminate the explicit-naming layer, leaving the report with one
syntactic layer, presumably called (r6rs records syntactic).

RESPONSE:

The suggestion will be adopted.
