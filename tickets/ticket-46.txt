Ticket #46 (defect)

LF should not be the only line separator

Section 3.2.1 contains the following production: 
     <intra-line whitespace> --> <any <whitespace> that is not <linefeed>

First, a minor, textual issue: the < and > tags do not balance (a > is
missing at the end of the line)

The major issue here is the choice to make "line feed" the only inter-
line separator.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline#Unicode, although far from
normative, states:

"The Unicode standard addresses the problem by defining a large number
of characters that conforming applications should recognize as line
terminators:

      LF:    Line Feed, u000A
      CR:    Carriage Return, u000D
      CR+LF: CR followed by LF, u000D followed by u000A
      NEL:   Next Line, u0085
      FF:    Form Feed, u000C
      LS:    Line Separator, u2028
      PS:    Paragraph Separator, u2029"

but in my reading, it is consistent with
http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14. If a goal of the spec is to make
Scheme Unicode compliant, it must follow the mandatory aspects of that
page.

When not making this change, be aware that source files will be
single-line on some (minority) platforms (examples: Mac OS 9 and
earlier, and if I read things correctly, EBCDIC-based systems)

This may mean additional changes to the grammar. I haven't completely
thought it over, but I think the cleanest approach would be to define
the lexical syntax as consisting of two phases, the first of which
normalizes line endings (say to LFs).
