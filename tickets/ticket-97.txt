Ticket #97 (enhancement)

Opened 1 week ago
Provide another formal comment period once the spec has settled down
Status: new	Reported by:	Michael Lenaghan	Assigned to:	sperber
Priority:	major	Milestone:	r6rs
Component:	other	Version:	5.91

Description

Reading through the Editor archives it appears that 5.91, the publicly
available version of the spec, doesn't reflect where things stood when
the formal comment period was opened. Furthermore, current Editor
discussions aren't available, so it's impossible to know what has
happened in the last two months. There's nothing wrong with any of
that, but it means of course that we're commenting on something other
than the current version of the spec.

Recommendation

Ideally the Editors should open one last formal comment period when
they are happy with the spec and don't expect any further changes on
their side.

RESPONSE:

The 5.91 draft reflects where things stood when the formal comment
period was opened.  However, a number of changes have been decided
upon, based on the discussion and on new insights the editors have
gained.  It's unclear whether the comment is based on the assumption
that the next draft will be the final draft of the R6RS.  This is not
the case: at least one draft beyond the next draft is planned, and,
depending on the state of the discussion and on the progress of
ratification by that time, more drafts will appear.
