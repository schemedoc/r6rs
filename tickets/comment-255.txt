Subject: [Formal] Identifiers beginning with "->" considered useless

Submitter: John Cowan
Issue type: Defect
Priority: Minor
Component:  Lexical syntax
Report version: 5.93
Summary: Identifiers beginning with "->" considered useless.

R5.93RS extends the lexical syntax of R5RS identifiers to allow
them to begin with "->", presumably for the sake of the R5.91
procedures "->exact" and "->inexact".  The former names of these
procedures, "exact->inexact" and "inexact->exact", were misleading,
since they accepted both exact and inexact arguments.  However,
5.93 renamed these "exact" and "inexact" per formal comment #203.

I believe that the principles given in that comment are of a general
nature such that names like "->foo" are always better given as "foo".
While I am no fan of arbitrary restrictions on names, I am not in favor
of arbitrary exceptions either.  I suggest that "->" prefixes should be
removed for R6RS.


RESPONSE:

Many existing Scheme implementations prior to R5.93RS already supported
identifiers starting with ->.  (Many readers would classify any
lexeme as an identifier starting with - for which {\cf
string->number} returns \schfalse{}.)  As a result, a significant
amount of otherwise portable Scheme code used identifiers starting
with ->, which are a convenient choice for many names.  Therefore,
R5.93RS legalizes these identifiers.  The separate production in the
grammar is not particularly elegant.  However, designing a more
elegant production that does not overlap with representations of
number objects or other lexeme classes has proved to be surprisingly
difficult.
