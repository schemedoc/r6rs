Subject: [Formal] fxlogical-shift-left and fxlogical-shift-right used but
	not defined.

type: Defect
priority: Minor
component: Arithmetic
version: 5.92
summary: fxlogical-shift-left and fxlogical-shift-right used but not 
defined.

The definitions on page 38 of fxbit-field, fxcopy-bit-field, and
fxrotate-bit-field all use fxlogical-shift-left, and two of them use
fxlogical-shift-right.  Neither of these procedures is defined.

fxlogical-shift-left can obviously safely be replaced with
bitwise-arithmetic-shift-left.  I suspect that overflow considerations
prevent the use of fxarithmetic-shift-left in fxcopy-bit-field and 
fxrotate-bit-field.

fxlogical-shift-right appears to only be called with positive
arguments, so it can safely be replaced with fxarithmetic-shift-right.
