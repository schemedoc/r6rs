Datum values, shared structure and eq? vs equal?

Description

The description of datum values in section 1.9 doesn't forbidd shared
structure. For example would the value of "(let ((x (cons (cons 1 2)
3))) (set-cdr! x (car x)) x)" return a datum value? I assume the
answer i "no" but it would be nice to make it explicit. Also in
section 3 (page 11, middle of right column) in the discussion of "(8
13)" vs "( 8 13 )" I think it should be defined what is meant by
"equal", by adding a reference to the predicate "equal?".

Proposal

Make it explicit in section 1.9 that shared or recursive structure is
forbidden. Add a reference to "equal?" in section 9.6.
