Formal comment #139 (defect)

The real->flonum procedure should be moved out of the base package
Reported by: 	Mike Sperber
Version:	5.92

As the `real->flonum' procedure produces a flonum, yet no
flonum-specific operations exist in the base library. However, it is
likely that `real->flonum' will typically be used in conjunction with
the procedures of the d (r6rs arithmetic flonum). Consequently, it
should be moved there.


RESPONSE:

Agreed.  The change will be made.
