Section: 6.1 Library form (pg 21) 

Dependencies: 6.4 Examples (pg 25) 

Summary

Add a multi-file library example. This will likely flush out some
under-specified issues that will affect the portability of libraries,
especially larger libraries.

Description

Libraries are arguably the single most important feature of R6RS. And,
arguably, one important reason for adding libraries is to improve the
portability of Scheme code.

R6RS currently contains a somewhat complex library example in section
6.4. That example specifically avoids saying anything about the
relationship between files and libraries. Although that's
understandable, it unfortunately leaves open the possibility that
libraries will fail to achieve their portability goal.

Imagine wrapping a large package like SSAX (an excellent Scheme-based
XML parser) in a library. The library form might look something like
this:

        (library (ssax (5 0))
                (export read-xml write-xml ...)
                (import r6rs)

                ...)

Libraries create scope; ultimately, all of SSAX's identifiers must be
defined within its library form. But SSAX is far too large to fit in
one file. So how are all of SSAX' pieces put together?

One obvious solution is to use an "include" form to include the
various files in the scope of the library definition. But "include"
isn't part of R6RS, so that isn't a portable solution.

Even if "incldue" is added, another problem pops up: how should the
included file be specified?

For example, here are some viable approaches: 

        (include "./reader.scm")

        (include "reader.scm")

        (include "ssax-5.0/reader.scm")

        (include "ssax-5.0" "reader.scm")

In the first two cases you can imagine that when the file containing
the library form is loaded or compiled or included it temporarily sets
the current directory to the directory containing the library
file. Now the include forms can use relative paths (either directly or
indirectly). In the second two cases you can imagine that the
implementation has one or more directories that it searches. Now the
include forms can assume they're relative to the directory the package
ships with.

These (and many other possibilities) are all reasonable choices--and
that's the problem. It's all too likely that different implementations
will make different decisions. As it stands it appears that R6RS
doesn't specify how to build a larger library like SSAX in a portable
way.

Of course, these issues extend to how the file containing the library
form is itself located.

Indeed, another question is whether or not SSAX should assume that any
libraries it needs for its own import have already been been made
available or whether it should include those files itself. Again,
demonstrating this in an example will help to flush out portability
issues. 

Recommendation

Add a multi-file library example. The example should probably
demonstrate a) how a library can be created from multiple files and b)
what assumptions a library can make about other liraries it needs
(should it include or only import?) and c) how the file containing the
library form can be located.

It's likely that building such an example will identify some issues
that are currently under-specified. For example, making the example
work may entail adding "include" to R6RS and it may entail saying
something about the assumptions users of "include" (and "load" and
such) can make (or not make).

DRAFT RESPONSE

We hope to produce an R6RS appendix that addresses practical problems,
including how library source code is related to the filesystem. This
is an excellent suggestion that we will take into account for that
section.

With respect to the observation that R6RS offers no construct for
private modules, we agree, but we're inclined to punt on that problem
for R6RS.
