Formal comment #206 (defect)

Scheme-6 should be differentiated from earlier versions
Reported by: 	Aubrey Jaffer
Version: 	5.92

Many unsupported and weakly supported Scheme implementations, and
possibly some supported ones, will remain at R5RS and call themselves
Scheme for years to come.

If both R5RS and R6RS implementations and code are described simply as
Scheme, then the confusion caused by the incompatibility between
Scheme and Scheme-6 will reflect poorly on the language and be an
obstacle to Scheme's wider acceptance.

Because R6RS is a major, incompatible change from earlier Reports,
occurrences of the word "Scheme" in R6RS should be changed to
"Scheme-6" when the aspect being discussed is incompatible with R5RS.


RESPONSE:

Every revision of the Scheme Revised Report series has made major
incompatible changes.  Moreover, many Scheme implementations did not
support R5RS long after it was released.  Arguably, this did cause
confusion even then.  However, correctly identifying the language or
language dialect of an implementation is the responsibility of the
implementation rather than the report itself.
