Subject: [Formal] Defun example should actually implement defun

Submitter: John Cowan
Issue type: Defect
Priority: Trivial
Component:  Macro expansion
Report version: 5.93
Summary: Defun example should actually implement defun

The defun example in report section 8 should actually implement
(simplified) defun rather than a mere clone of define.

(lambda (x)
  (define-syntax defun
    (syntax-rules ()
      [(_ x a e) (define x (lambda a e))]))
  (defun even? (n) (or = n 0) (odd? (- n 1))))

etc.


RESPONSE:

This change was made.
