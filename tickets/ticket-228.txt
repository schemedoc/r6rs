Formal comment #228 (simplification)

The components of a compound condition should be independent
Reported by: 	John Cowan
Version: 	5.92

In R5.92RS, a condition may contain any number of component
conditions. However, if two or more of the components are of the same
exact type, then condition-ref will be able to retrieve the fields
only of the first such component, not the others. A fortiori, if a
condition contains two components foo and bar of types &foo and &bar
respectively, such that &foo is a supertype of &bar, then asking for a
field of &foo will return the value from whichever component appears
first.

In order to simplify the use of conditions, I propose to make it an
error to create a compound condition with two or more components of
the same type, unless that type has no fields. This means that the
order of component conditions no longer matters.

None of the standard condition types of report section 6.3 conflict in
this way, but it would mean, for example, that the condition created
by the "error" procedure could not be compounded with another such,
nor with any simple condition of type &who, &irritants, or &message.

If this is done, then the acccessor procedures defined by
define-condition-type can be applied to compound as well as simple
conditions of that type, since the result will not be ambiguous or
order-dependent. (R5.92RS is silent on using such an accessor on a
compound condition.)
