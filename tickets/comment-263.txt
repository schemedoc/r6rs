Subject: [Formal] `#\newline' should be reinstated
Message-ID: <87odjj7ze8.fsf@laas.fr>

Type of Issue:  Defect
Priority:       Major
Component:      Language
Report:         Revised^5.94 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme
Summary:        `#\newline' should be reinstated

`#\newline' was removed from the language (see Appendix E of R5.94RS).
However, to my knowledge, the motivations for this change we not
clarified.

Conversely, people on the `r6rs-discuss' list acknowledged that removing
it may be a gratuitous nuisance [0].

I suggest either reinstating it or a least discussing the rationale for
removing it.

Thanks,
Ludovic.
