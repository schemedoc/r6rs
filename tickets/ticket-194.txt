Formal comment #194 (enhancement)

hash-table-mutable? vs hash-table-immutable?
Reported by: 	Daniel Villeneuve
Version: 	5.92

SUMMARY

The predicate about mutability of hash-tables would be better defined
as hash-table-immutable?.

DESCRIPTION

I suggest that the predicate to test about mutability/immutability of
hash-tables be named hash-table-immutable? for the following reasons:

a) This is the property that is given to hash-table-copy.

b) Among all Scheme collections, immutability is the exception, and
   this is what we want to single out.

c) I think that the most frequent idiom for this predicate is

(define (some-function-modifying-a-hash-table! ht)
  (if (not (hash-table-mutable? ht))
     (error ...)))

which can be written a little more succinctly as

(define (some-function-modifying-a-hash-table! ht)
  (if (hash-table-immutable? ht)
     (error ...)))

PROPOSAL

Replace hash-table-mutable? by hash-table-immutable?.


RESPONSE

The proposal will be adopted in the next draft of the Report.
