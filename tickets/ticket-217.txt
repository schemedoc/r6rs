Formal comment #217 (defect)

eol-style: Explain what the identifier "ls" means
Reported by: 	Arthur A. Gleckler
Version: 	5.92

In <7.2.4. Transcoders>, explain what the identifier "ls" means. "Line
style" is an obvious meaning, but then what specific line style is
that? I must be missing something obvious.

DRAFT RESPONSE:

LS is U+2028. The meanings of the line styles will be clarified (and
revised) in the next draft. See also formal comment 185.
