Issue type: Defect
Priority: Minor
Component: Lexical Syntax
Report version: 5.94
Summary: please repair and simplify lexical syntax

Full description of issue:

The current draft's description of lexical
syntax contains several technical errors.
The lexical description is also so complex
as to invite controversy concerning its
interpretation.  For example, I count well
over 800,000 distinct errors in the current
reference implementation of get-datum, but
its author does not agree that these are
errors [private communication].

Implementations of the R5RS were allowed to
simplify the lexical syntax by extending it
to a simpler and more regular syntax that
includes the required R5RS syntax as a proper
sublanguage.  Many did so.  One of the more
popular extensions adds an <identifier-like>
nonterminal, which generates all identifiers,
all numbers, and many non-R5RS tokens besides.
Any <identifier-like> token that is rejected
by number->string is then accepted as an
identifier.  The current draft R6RS forbids
the use of such extensions to simplify the
lexical syntax.

Hence simplicity of lexical syntax has become
more important for the R6RS than it was in the
R5RS.  Unfortunately, the lexical syntax has
become more complicated, not simpler.

                * * *

Details:

The end of input is not listed as a lexeme, but
it probably should be.

The current draft says "Identifiers, numbers,
characters, booleans, and dot must be terminated
by a <delimiter> (e.g. parenthesis, space, or
comment) or by the end of the input."

That sounds like an excellent requirement, but
it is vacuous.  According to the formal syntax,
a <delimiter> can be <interlexeme space>, and
the empty sequence of characters is one kind of
<interlexeme space>, so it is simply impossible
for a lexeme (other than the end of input) not
to be followed by a <delimiter>.

The solution I recommend is to change the first
production of <delimiter> to <whitespace>.

In the 5.94 draft, the following are legal:

    foo#;13#;15()          ; read as foo ()
    foo#|comment|#()       ; read as foo ()
    foo#!r6rs#!r6rs()      ; read as foo ()

but the following are illegal:

    foo#()
    foo#!r5rs#!r5rs()

Treating #!r6rs as a delimiter, but not #!r5rs
or #!fold-case, is especially confusing.

I recommend the addition of # to the list of
delimiters.  This might cause problems for
backwards compatibility, however, since several
systems have been allowing # as a <subsequent>.

Since there are over 235,000 Unicode characters
that can begin an R6RS identifier, programmers
are likely to assume that identifiers can begin
with any alphabetic character.  With the current
draft, however, 163 alphabetic characters (of
Unicode 5.0.0) cannot begin an identifier.  This
should be fixed.

The peculiar identifiers that begin with ->
are not needed by the current draft, and are
no more useful than many other extensions that
are just as widely implemented.  There is no
principled reason for the R6RS to allow the
-> peculiarities while forbidding others.
Either remove the -> wart from the lexical
syntax, or generalize the lexical syntax so
the -> identifiers are no longer exceptions to
the general rules for constructing identifiers.

Scheme's lexical syntax for numbers has always
been complex, but the draft R6RS proposes to
make that more of a problem by outlawing
simplifying extensions.  I think it is time to
drop the # notation for insignificant digits.
Our earlier discussion of this revealed general
confusion concerning its semantics, and it also
appears that hardly anyone uses it.  The R6RS
<mantissa width> is arguably a better solution
than the # notation, and should replace it.

The #\nul, #\esc, and #\delete characters have no
corresponding two-letter escape sequence in strings,
while the other eight named characters do.  This
seems arbitrary and capricious.

The formal syntax is ambiguous, which implies it
is not LR.  This creates unnecessary obstacles
to the use of some standard scanner and parser
generators.  The ambiguities I have noticed so
far include:

    The fact that any two input characters are
    separated by <interlexeme space>.

    The first two productions for <string element>
    overlap.

    The first and third productions for <ureal 10>
    overlap.

    The two productions for <prefix R> overlap.
