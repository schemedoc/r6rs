Subject: [Formal] Formal comment #154 resolution not implemented
Message-ID: <20070605191156.GF28763@mercury.ccil.org>

Submitter: John Cowan
Email address: cowan at ccil.org
Issue type: Defect
Priority: Minor
Component: Syntax
Report version: 5.93
Summary: Formal comment #154 not implemented

The resolution to formal comment #154 (which proposed that (), vectors,
and bytevectors be made self-evaluating) stated:

	Generally, Scheme has often favored uniformity over succinctness,
	which is also why vector datums are not literals.  However,
	bytevector datums will be made self-evaluating in the next draft
	of the report.

However, bytevectors are not self-evaluating in R5.93RS per report
section 3.3.4.  I propose that they be made so, and that the rejection
of self-evaluating vectors be reconsidered as well.  There is a clear
reason not to make symbols and pairs self-evaluating, but not so for
the other datum types.
