Formal comment #59 (enhancement)

Vector size in the read syntax
Reported by:	Jens Axel Søgaard

Component:	lexicalsyntax
Version:	5.91

Proposal

In section "3.3.2 Vectors" the read syntax of vector datums are 

     #(<datum> ...) .

I propose to allow the following syntax: 

     #<natural number>(<datum> ...)

The natural number between the # and the opening parenthesis denotes
the vector size.

If there are fewer <datum>s than the given size, the vector is filled
with the value denoted by the last <datum>. E.g #4(0 1) denotes #(0 1
1 1).

If no datums are present the vector is filled with 0. E.g. #4()
denotes #(0 0 0 0).

More more <datum>s than the given size is not allowed. Rationale

The #<number>(<datum> ...) requires less memory to parse.

During the parsing of, say, #100000(1 2 ...), the reader can allocate
the vector after seeing the #100000( and then fill in the vector
slots.

With the #(1 2 ...) syntax the reader needs to allocate a temporary
data structure to hold the data, until all datums have been read. Then
the vector can be allocated and the slots be filled.

Current Practice

Chez Scheme

Vectors may be printed with an explicit length prefix, and when the
explicit length prefix is specified, duplicate trailing elements may
be omitted. For example, #(a b c) may be printed as #3(a b c), and a
vector of length 100 containing all zeros may be printed as
#100(0). The printer generally prints the prefix and suppresses
duplicate trailing elements unless the parameter print-vector-length
is set to false.

PLT Scheme

Vector constants can be unquoted, and a vector size can be specified
with a decimal integer between the # and opening parenthesis. If the
specified size is larger than the number of vector elements that are
provided, the last specified element is used to fill the remaining
vector slots. For example, #4(1 2) is equivalent to #(1 2 2 2). If no
vector elements are specified, the vector is filled with 0. If a
vector size is provided and it is smaller than the number of elements
provided, the exn:fail:read exception is raised.

SISC

SISC supports the length prefix method of creating Vector
constants. For example, '#5(x) creates a vector constant containing
five identical symbols. In addition, the length-prefix form is used
when printing vectors, and if elements repeat at the end of a Vector,
only the last unique element is printed. This form is referred to as
the compact vector representation. The unprefixed form with all
elements displayed is called the verbose representation.

Two of the three systems that allow the proposed syntax
also use it (by default) when writing vectors, which has
been a barrier to portability.  There are two obvious ways
to fix this non-portability: require the implementations
that are using the syntax to stop using it (as was done
by the current draft), or require all implementations
to support it (as the comment proposes).

In the current draft R6RS, choices of this kind were
generally settled by requiring implementations that use
the nonstandard syntax to stop using it, unless those
implementations are represented by at least two editors.
That is a silly precedent, however, and the R6RS might
find greater acceptance within the Scheme community if
the editors would refrain from preferring their own pet
extensions over those of other implementations.

On the other hand, the proposed extension does not do
a great deal of harm.  The main issue is whether it has
been implemented by enough systems and is important
enough to be required of all R6RS-conformant systems.
