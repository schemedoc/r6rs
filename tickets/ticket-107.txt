Ticket #107 (defect)

Scheme should not be changed to be case sensitive

In <3.2. Lexical syntax>: Scheme should not be case sensitive. After
thirty years, what new argument came up to justify this change? Does
this mean that (eq? 'symbol 'SYMBOL) ==> #f ? This means that years of
tradition of writing quoted symbols in upper case in macros for
clarity will end and that lots of existing code will have to be
painstakingly pored over and fixed with no clear benefit.

RESPONSE:

While there are many technical arguments in favor of both case
sensitivity and case insensitivity, the editors decided to switch to
case sensitivity because they perceived that a majority of the Scheme
community favored the change.  This perception has been strengthened
by polls at the 2004 Scheme workshop, on the plt-scheme mailing list,
and the r6rs-discuss mailing list.
