Ticket #107 (defect)

Scheme should not be changed to be case sensitive

In <3.2. Lexical syntax>: Scheme should not be case sensitive. After
thirty years, what new argument came up to justify this change? Does
this mean that (eq? 'symbol 'SYMBOL) ==> #f ? This means that years of
tradition of writing quoted symbols in upper case in macros for
clarity will end and that lots of existing code will have to be
painstakingly pored over and fixed with no clear benefit.
