Discussion

Currently ...-list->bytes and bytes->...list procedures are supplied
to convert bytes vectors to lists of numbers and back. However, where
one has the choice, programming with lists of numbers tend to be less
efficient than programming with vectors of numbers.

It may be useful to supply ...-vector->bytes and ...-bytes->vector
procedures in addition to, or maybe preferably instead of, the
list-based procedures. Since these can be implemented extremely
efficiently, it seems a pity not to provide them.

RESPONSE:

We agree that these may be nice, especially with the addition vector-map
and vector-for-each (see the response to formal comment 78).  A number of
other converters might also be nice, like string->vector, vector->string,
as well as other flavors of ...-bytes->list, list->...-bytes,
...-bytes->vector, and vector->...-bytes that store or extract other forms
of data, like 16-, 32, and 64-bit signed and unsigned integers, single
floats, double floats, characters.  Rather than adding all possibly useful
such converters, it might be better to retain lists as the canonical
intermediate form and encourage compilers to optimize expressions of the
form (list->xxx (yyy->list ---)) into code that does the yyy->xxx
conversion directly.  In the absence of a concrete proposal for dealing
with this issue holistically, however, the editors have decided to keep
the status quo.
