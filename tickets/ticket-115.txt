Discussion

Currently ...-list->bytes and bytes->...list procedures are supplied
to convert bytes vectors to lists of numbers and back. However, where
one has the choice, programming with lists of numbers tend to be less
efficient than programming with vectors of numbers.

It may be useful to supply ...-vector->bytes and ...-bytes->vector
procedures in addition to, or maybe preferably instead of, the
list-based procedures. Since these can be implemented extremely
efficiently, it seems a pity not to provide them.
