Formal comment #37 (defect)

Multiple value expressions in scripts
Reported by:	Andre van Tonder

Component:	scripts
Version:	5.91

Page : 27 
Summary

The current description of script semantics does not allow multiple
return values for expressions preceding definitions. A small typo is
also pointed out.

Description

The draft states: "each <expression> that appears before a variable
definition in the script body is converted into a dummy definition
(define <variable> <expression>), where <variable> is fresh
identifier."

(First a typo: "variable definition" should presumably be "variable or
syntax definition".)

Thes description does not allow <expression> to return multiple
values. This restriction was presumably not the intent of the authors.

RESPONSE:

This will be fixed in the next draft of the report.
