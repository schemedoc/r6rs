Formal comment #140 (enhancement)

Max and min with zero arguments
Reported by: 	John Cowan
Version:	5.92

Summary: Max and min should be allowed to have zero arguments.

In R5RS the max and min functions must take at least one argument,
because there is no universal maximum or minimum. In R6RS, however, we
have +0.inf and -0.inf. I suggest, therefore, that (max) => -0.inf and
(min) => +0.inf. This also allows multiple-argument max and min to be
defined using a fold primitive ver two-argument versions.

Alex Shinn's remarks on #scheme inspired this comment, but he is not
to be held responsible for it.
