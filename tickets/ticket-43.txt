Formal comment #43 (defect)

(+ x 42) adds 42 to x, not x to 42
Reported by:	Reinder Verlinde
Priority:	minor
Component:	other
Version:	5.91

Section 1.5, last paragraph (page 7, right column, at the top) reads:

"The entire expression in this example is a procedure call; its
operator is (lambda (x) (+ x 42)), which evaluates to a procedure that
takes a single number and add it to 42."

I think that should read "and adds 42 to it". It is only a character
longer and 'more correct'. At the very least, replace "add" by "adds"
to make the sentence grammatically correct.

RESPONSE:

This will be fixed in the next draft of the report.
