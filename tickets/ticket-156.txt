Formal comment #156 (defect)

Rename the unspecified value
Reported by: 	John Cowan
Version:	5.92

Many R5.91RS commentators expressed a strong dislike for the name "the
unspecified value", because of the strong potential for confusion
between "is the unspecified value" and "is unspecified". (This should
be distinguished from a strong dislike that an overlapping set of
commentator expressed for the *concept* of allowing such procedures to
return any value whatever.)

The editor should choose a different name and then stick to
it. Attempting to get consensus about the name is hopeless and
probably misconceived.

RESPONSE:

The unspecified value will be removed in the next draft of the report.
