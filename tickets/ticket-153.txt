Formal comment #153 (defect)


Rename on export considered harmful
Status: closed (worksforme)
Reported by: 	John Cowan
Version:	5.92

Summary: Renaming identifiers on export should be strongly justified
or abandoned.

Report section 6.1 provides a facility for renaming identifiers on
export from a library, but no explanation is given for it. The need to
rename identifiers on import is plain, as they may need to change to
avoid conflicts with other imported or local identifiers. At export
time, however, such conflicts are not known.

Having two different "native" identifiers in a library is overkill. It
is the very simplest of refactorings to globally change all the
instances of identifiers in a given module, and that ought to be
sufficient. Either remove the facility or give a strong justification
for it, please.
