Subject: [Formal] Library Section 11.3 "Exact bitwise arithmetic" should
	cite SRFI-60.

	         submitter's name: Aubrey Jaffer
		    type of issue: Defect
		         priority: Minor
		   R6RS component: Exact bitwise arithmetic
	    version of the report: 5.94
one-sentence summary of the issue: 

Library Section 11.3 "Exact bitwise arithmetic" should cite SRFI-60.

    full description of the issue:

Except for name changes (mostly prepending bitwise-), R5.94RS Library
Section 11.3 "Exact bitwise arithmetic" follows SRFI-60 closely.  But
while other SRFIs are cited in the References section, SRFI-60 is not.

SRFI-60 should be added to the References section and cited in
library section 11.3 "Exact bitwise arithmetic".


RESPONSE:

A citation of SRFIs 60 has been added to the rationale document.  To
avoid confusion about the changes between the SRFIs and the report,
the citations of SRFIs have been moved to the rationale document, with
brief explanations.
