Subject: [Formal] Library Section 11.3 "Exact bitwise arithmetic" should
	cite SRFI-60.

	         submitter's name: Aubrey Jaffer
		    type of issue: Defect
		         priority: Minor
		   R6RS component: Exact bitwise arithmetic
	    version of the report: 5.94
one-sentence summary of the issue: 

Library Section 11.3 "Exact bitwise arithmetic" should cite SRFI-60.

    full description of the issue:

Except for name changes (mostly prepending bitwise-), R5.94RS Library
Section 11.3 "Exact bitwise arithmetic" follows SRFI-60 closely.  But
while other SRFIs are cited in the References section, SRFI-60 is not.

SRFI-60 should be added to the References section and cited in
library section 11.3 "Exact bitwise arithmetic".


RESPONSE:

As a general rule, the main report documents only cite SRFIs that have
been adopted without change.  Citations of SRFIs 33 and 60 appear in
the rationale document.
