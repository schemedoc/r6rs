Ticket #32 (defect)

The definition of eval needs refining
Status: new

The phrase 

"Specifically, if the first argument to eval is a definition, it must
raise an exception with condition type &eval-definition".

should be replaced with something like

"Any types of top level definitions are not allowed"

Because, any of the samples below will break the first rule (and
security):

(eval '(begin (define a 3) ...) ... )
(eval '(macro-begin '(+ 1 2) (define a 3) ...) ...)
(evel '(my-define-macro a) ...)

With a such security hole "eval" is unusable for sandboxing, because
enviroment function can return the same object for optimization
reasons.

(eq? (environment (r6rs)) (environment (r6rs)) ==> #t

The phrase "The bindings of the environment represented by a specifier
are immutable" are superfluous, because according (6.1) all exported
library definitions are immutable:

"All explicitly exported variables are immutable in both the exporting
and importing libraries"

DRAFT RESPONSE

The first argument to eval must not expand into a definition. This
should be clarified.

We agree that "The bindings of the environment represented by a
specifier are immutable" is superfluous. Whether such redundant
statements should be included within the R6RS is an editorial decision
that has no technical import.
