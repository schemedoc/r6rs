Formal comment #9 (defect)

backslash-linefeed
Reported by:	Per Bothner
Priority:	minor

3.2.6 \<linefeed><intraline whitespace> : nothing 

Should be: \<intraline whitespace><linefeed><intraline whitespace> 

Having a syntax that is suspectible to invisible trailing whitespace
is a bad idea (even if it is traditional).

This change may be viewed as conflicting with: 

\<space> space "useful for terminating the previous escape sequence
before continuing with whitespace"

However, there is no problem, since \<space> is useless - I see no
specification for an escape sequence that might need such a
terminator.

RESPONSE:

Agreed. The \<space> terminator was meant to work with
\<linefeed><intraline whitespace> in the case that the continuation
should start with a whitespace. However, \x escapes can serve that
purpose equally well.
