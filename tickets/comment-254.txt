Subject: [Formal] Confusing formatting in report section 9.16
Message-ID: <20070605195641.GE18038@mercury.ccil.org>

Submitter: John Cowan
Email address: cowan at ccil.org
Issue type: Defect
Priority: Trivial
Component:  Base library
Report version: 5.93
Summary: Confusing formatting in report section 9.16

The second sentence in the description of apply reads:

	*Proc* should accept *n* arguments, where *n* is number of
	*arg*s plus the length of *args*.

The distinction between "*arg*s" and "*args*" is too subtle to
be easily seen.  I suggest replacing "*args*" with "*more-args*"
or the like.  Also, s/is number/is the number/.

       Look'd like haiku.  He              Much better for two."
