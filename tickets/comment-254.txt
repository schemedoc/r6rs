Issue type: Defect
Priority: Trivial
Component:  Base library
Report version: 5.93
Summary: Confusing formatting in report section 9.16

The second sentence in the description of apply reads:

	*Proc* should accept *n* arguments, where *n* is number of
	*arg*s plus the length of *args*.

The distinction between "*arg*s" and "*args*" is too subtle to
be easily seen.  I suggest replacing "*args*" with "*more-args*"
or the like.  Also, s/is number/is the number/.
