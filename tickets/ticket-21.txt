Formal comment #21 (defect)

"Unicode 9" etc. is bad wording
Reported by:	John Cowan
Priority:	trivial
Component:	unicode
Version:	5.91

To refer to the Unicode control characters, rather than "Unicode 9"
write "U+0009", for "Unicode 10" write "U+000A", and so on. Nobody
uses decimal numbers for Unicode characters, and "Unicode 9" looks
like a version of Unicode rather than a codepoint.

RESPONSE:

This suggestion will be adopted in the next draft of the report.
