Formal comment #224 (defect)

get-bytevector-some may be difficult to implement
Reported by: 	Per Bothner
Version: 	5.92

It is unclear to me how one would implement get-bytevector-some. I
don't think it can be implemented reasonably using the read call-back
function of make-custom-binary-port. The best I can think of:
allocated some largish buffer, call the read call-back, and the
re-allocate a new bytevector with however many bytes were actually
read. But that still won't return "a freshly allocated bytevector of
non-zero size containing the available data" - just "a freshly
allocated bytevector of non-zero size containing *part* of the
available data". And it means allocating a temporary large bytevector
and throwing it away.

Fix: remove get-bytevector-some, or clarify that it reads "one or more
of the available characters". I suggest the former.


RESPONSE:

How efficient implementations based on `read' are depends on the
implementation: Some storage manager allow allocating a vector-like
object and shrinking it later.  Some operating systems might allow
finding out the number of available bytes before actually requiring a
buffer to be allocated.  Moreover, even if `get-bytes-some' isn't very
efficient on custom ports, it may still be efficient for other kinds
of ports.  In any case, the actual I/O overhead is likely to be
significantly larger than the allocation overhead for a bytevector.
Therefore, `get-bytevector-some' will be retained.

The specification of `get-bytevector-some' will be clarified to say
that it reads one or more of the available bytes.
