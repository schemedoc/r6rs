The name bytevector should be hyphenated

In <3.3.4 Bytevectors> and throughout, the name "bytevector" should be
hyphenated to be consistent with hash tables and section 5.6 Naming
Conventions, paragraph 5.

RESPONSE:

The editors regard "bytevector" as an idiomatic term, rather than as
implying that a bytevector is a vector of bytes.  However, the
"hashtable" name constituent will be renamed to "hash-table", to
restore consistency.
