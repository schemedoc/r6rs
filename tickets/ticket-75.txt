Summary

Conditions can be simplified by following a well-understood
object-interface model. Description

The rules for repeated fields seem to convey an intent that conditions
be thought of as objects implementing more than one "condition type"
interface. If so, why not make a much simpler representation by
following well-understood object models, such as the Java model, as
follows:

Think of condition types as "interfaces" and condition objects as
objects of anonymous type that "implement" these interfaces. Drop
compound conditions and drop the procedures "make-compound-condition"
and "extract-condition", flatten the fields eliminating repeats and
list all the implemented interfaces (= condition types) as part of the
object. A condition object can then be created as

   (make-condition list-of-types field-name obj ...)

For example 

   (make-condition '(&message &who)  ; implements two interfaces
     'condition-message "phone me"
     'condition-who "mother")

which can be represented internally as a list of types (interfaces)
and a flat alist of fields. The syntactic API for the compound example
in the document could be the more concise

(define v3 (condition (&c1 &c2)  ; implements two interfaces
              (x "V3/1")
              (a "a3")
              (b "b3")))

If downcasting to a particular interface is really required (the
analogue of the current "extract-condition") it can also be easily
implemented in this representation.

The suggested representation is simpler, since compound conditions can
be dropped is more concise better expresses the "object implements
interfaces/mixins" idea. gets rid of the current complicated semantics
of repeated fields reproduces the practically and theoretically
well-understood "object implementing interfaces" idea in languages
like Java.

The current wording does seem to convey an intent of trying to
approximate the "object implementing interfaces" idea. I quote:

"Each type-field-binding must contain field bindings for all fields of
condition-type without duplicates. There is an exception to this rule:
if a field binding is missing, and the field belongs to a supertype
shared with one of the other htype-field-bindingi subforms, then the
value defaults to that of the first such binding in the condition
form."

But this expresses the "object implementing interfaces" idea very
awkwardly in imperfectly. The above suggested encoding does it better
in my opinion and is easier to understand, especially for people with
prior exposure to object models similar to Java's.

The current specification has several further issues, which would fall
away if the model were simplified as above: It is not clear if the
type of conditions is the recursive type 

<condition> ::= (make-condition ---) / (make-compound-condition <condition> ...)

which would allow make-compound-condition to be nested, or the
alternative non-recursive type

<simple-condition> ::= (make-condition ---)
<condition> ::= <simple-condition> / (make-compound-condition <simple-condition> ...)  If the recursive type, then "condition-ref"

is not fully specified in case of repeated fields, since it is not
specified if the search for the first field is e.g. depth-first. Same
for "extract-condition" if the type is recursive above.

Suggestion

As in above text: drop "make-compound-condition". drop complex
descrioptions of field priorities. drop "extract-condition", unless
downcasting ability is a requirement, in which case I would preferably
use a different name for it. modify "make-condition" procedure as
described above modify "condition" syntax as described above

RESPONSE:

====
The condition system distinguishes between simple conditions and
compound conditions.  A compound condition consists of an ordered set
of simple conditions.  Thus, every condition can be viewed as an
ordered set of simple component conditions: If it is simple, the set
consists of the condition itself; if it is compound, it consists of
the simple conditions that compose it.

====
The following procedures replace the ones in the current draft:

(make-condition-type id parent field-names) <as before>

(condition-type? thing) <as before>

(make-condition type alist)

Make-condition creates a simple condition value belonging condition
type type. The following arguments must be an association list mapping
field names to arbitrary values.  There must be a pair in the
association list for each field of type and its direct and indirect
supertypes. Make-condition returns the condition value, with the
argument values associated with their respective fields.

(condition? thing) <as before>

(condition-has-type? condition condition-type) <as before>

(condition->list condition)

Condition must be a condition.  This returns a list of the component
conditions of condition.

(condition-ref condition type field-name)

Condition must be a condition, type a condition type, and field-name a
symbol naming a field of type or its direct or indirect supertypes.
Moreover, condition must be a simple condition of type type, or a
compound condition containing a simple condition of type type.
Condition-ref returns the value of the field named by field-name in
the first component condition of condition that has type type.

(make-compound-condition condition0 ...)

Make-compound-condition returns a compound condition consisting of the
component conditions of condition0, condition1, in that order.

====
The following replaces the current specification of the `condition'
macro:

(condition <type-field binding> ...)

This creates a condition value. Each <type-field binding> must be of
the form

( <condition type> <field binding> ...)

Each <field binding> must be of the form

( <field name> <exp> )

where <field> is a field identifier from the definition of
<condition-type>.

The condition returned by condition is created by a call of form
(make-compound-condition
  (make-condition <condition-type> (list (cons '<field-name> <exp>) ...))
  ...)

with the condition types retaining their order from the condition
form.
