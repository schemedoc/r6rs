Summary

Conditions can be simplified by following a well-understood
object-interface model. Description

The rules for repeated fields seem to convey an intent that conditions
be thought of as objects implementing more than one "condition type"
interface. If so, why not make a much simpler representation by
following well-understood object models, such as the Java model, as
follows:

Think of condition types as "interfaces" and condition objects as
objects of anonymous type that "implement" these interfaces. Drop
compound conditions and drop the procedures "make-compound-condition"
and "extract-condition", flatten the fields eliminating repeats and
list all the implemented interfaces (= condition types) as part of the
object. A condition object can then be created as

   (make-condition list-of-types field-name obj ...)

For example 

   (make-condition '(&message &who)  ; implements two interfaces
     'condition-message "phone me"
     'condition-who "mother")

which can be represented internally as a list of types (interfaces)
and a flat alist of fields. The syntactic API for the compound example
in the document could be the more concise

(define v3 (condition (&c1 &c2)  ; implements two interfaces
              (x "V3/1")
              (a "a3")
              (b "b3")))

If downcasting to a particular interface is really required (the
analogue of the current "extract-condition") it can also be easily
implemented in this representation.

The suggested representation is simpler, since compound conditions can
be dropped is more concise better expresses the "object implements
interfaces/mixins" idea. gets rid of the current complicated semantics
of repeated fields reproduces the practically and theoretically
well-understood "object implementing interfaces" idea in languages
like Java.

The current wording does seem to convey an intent of trying to
approximate the "object implementing interfaces" idea. I quote:

"Each type-field-binding must contain field bindings for all fields of
condition-type without duplicates. There is an exception to this rule:
if a field binding is missing, and the field belongs to a supertype
shared with one of the other htype-field-bindingi subforms, then the
value defaults to that of the first such binding in the condition
form."

But this expresses the "object implementing interfaces" idea very
awkwardly in imperfectly. The above suggested encoding does it better
in my opinion and is easier to understand, especially for people with
prior exposure to object models similar to Java's.

The current specification has several further issues, which would fall
away if the model were simplified as above: It is not clear if the
type of conditions is the recursive type 

<condition> ::= (make-condition ---) / (make-compound-condition <condition> ...)

which would allow make-compound-condition to be nested, or the
alternative non-recursive type

<simple-condition> ::= (make-condition ---)
<condition> ::= <simple-condition> / (make-compound-condition <simple-condition> ...)  If the recursive type, then "condition-ref"

is not fully specified in case of repeated fields, since it is not
specified if the search for the first field is e.g. depth-first. Same
for "extract-condition" if the type is recursive above.

Suggestion

As in above text: drop "make-compound-condition". drop complex
descrioptions of field priorities. drop "extract-condition", unless
downcasting ability is a requirement, in which case I would preferably
use a different name for it. modify "make-condition" procedure as
described above modify "condition" syntax as described above

RESPONSE:

The condition system will be simplified in the next draft along the
lines of the outline on the mailing list at
