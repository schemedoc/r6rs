The "real->single" and "real->double" procedures are restricted
to real numbers. Why not rename them "->single" and "->double"
and allow them to operate on complex numbers too?

DRAFT RESPONSE

When given a complex number that is not real, the result would
presumably be an inexact complex number whose real and imaginary
parts are inexact reals that best approximate the best possible
IEEE single and double precision approximations to the real and
imaginary parts of the original argument.

This is a good suggestion, although the utility of the suggested
procedures might not justify their inclusion in the R6RS when
they can be defined so easily in terms of real->single and
real->double:

    (define (->single z)
      (make-rectangular (real->single (real-part z))
                        (real->single (imag-part z))))

It has been suggested, however, that number->single and
number->double might be better names for these procedures.
