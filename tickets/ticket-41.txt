Summary

Slight defect in formal definition of plausible lists. Description

There are various sentences similar to the following:

"A plausible list up to n between times t_0 and t_n is a Scheme value
x such that..."

"A plausible list (alist) between times t_0 and t_n is a plausible
list (alist) of some length n between those times."

Here the n in "up to n" and "of some length n" does not appear to have
anything to do with the n in "t_n". For example, if they were confused
to be the same, the second quotation above would not mean what
presumably was the intention of the author to say. Suggestion

Rather say, for example: 

"A plausible list (alist) between times t_0 and t_f is a plausible
list (alist) of some length n between those times."

RESPONSE:

The next draft of the report will address this issue in a manner
consistent with our resolution of formal comment #87.  In particular,
the description of plausible lists and alists may be eliminated
altogether.
