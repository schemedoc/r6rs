Scheme

    * In <Summary>, since the summary consists almost entirely of a
      list of chapters, it would be better to organize it one line per
      chapter than as a paragraph. At least start each sentence
      describing a chapter on a separate line. There's plenty of room
      on the page.

    * In <4.4 Argument checking, paragraph 2>: "Also, the procedure
      might escape to a different continuation, preventing the
      operation to perform more checks." "...to perform..." should be
      "...from performing...."

    * In <6.1. Library form>, hyphenate "subversion." The current name
      is an amusing pun, but it literally has the wrong meaning and
      the pun is already being used as the name of an unrelated
      version control system.

    * In the last paragraph of <6.2. Import and export levels>,
      "...the phase of an identifier use cannot be..." should be
      "...the phase of an identifier's use cannot be...."

    * In <6.3.1. Primitive expression types>, in the example in
      <Procedure calls>, capitalize the comment and end it with a
      period. It is a sentence.

    * In <8. Expansion process>, under "expression,
      i.e. nondefinition," and in the last paragraph in the section,
      either define the term "residualizes" or don't use it. It's not
      an English word, and its meaning here isn't obvious.

    * In <9.5.5. Derived conditionals> and <9.5.6. Binding
      constructs>, use the plural instead of "result(s)," "value(s),"
      and "is(are)." It's clearer and equally correct.

    * In <9.10. Booleans>, the note ends "...distinguishes both #f and
      the empty list from the symbol nil." Go further and say
      "...distinguishes #f and the empty list from each other and from
      the symbol nil." All three are distinct.

Scheme Standard Libraries

    * In <Summary>, since the summary consists almost entirely of a
      list of chapters, it would be better to organize it one line per
      chapter than as a paragraph. At least start each sentence
      describing a chapter on a separate line. There's plenty of room
      on the page.

    * In <2.1. General operations>, the paragraph describing
      native-endianness ends with this sentence: "This may be any
      endianness symbol, specifically a symbol other than big and
      little." This seems to say that big and little are not
      acceptable return values, but aren't they? Should this say
      "including" instead of "specifically?"

    * In <2.5. Operations on 32-bit integers>, operations on 64-bit
      integers and IEEE single-precision reals are included. Two
      section headers are missing.

    * The second paragraph in <6. Exceptions and conditions> begins: 

        The exception system allows the program, when it detects an
        exceptional situation, to pass control to an exception
        handler, and for dynamically establishing such exception
        handlers.

    "...for dynamically establishing such exception handlers..."
    should be "to establish such exception handlers dynamically."
    "For" isn't consistent with the beginning of the sentence.

    * In <7.2.5. End of file object>, there is a missing line break
      before the eq? example.

    * In <7.2.8. Binary input> and elsewhere the prefix "lookahead"
      should be hyphenated. The unhyphenated form is usually used as a
      noun.
