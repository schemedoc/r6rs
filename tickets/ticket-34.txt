Summary

Confusing language, typos and missing examples. 

Description

- The descriptions of forall and exists are confusing and incomplete. 

  For example, it is not stated that proc must take as many arguments
  as there are lists. Also, it is not explained what applying proc
  "elementwise" means. - The last example of each of forall and exists
  are missing closing parentheses.

- There is no example with more than one list argument. 

Proposal

The descriptions in SRFI-1 are a little clearer (though not entirely
applicable), and contains examples with more than one list.

RESPONSE:

This will be fixed in the next draft of the report.
