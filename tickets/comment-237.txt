Subject: [Formal] div and mod should have examples with x1 negative

summary: div and mod should have examples with x1 negative

All of the examples of the div and mod operations in section 9.3.3 on
page 40 have x1 positive, which misses an opportunity for readers to
confirm that they've understood the operations correctly.  I would
suggest adding some of the following:

 -5 div 3 = -2
-5 div -3 = 2
 -5 mod 3 = 1
-5 mod -3 = 1
