asymmetry between fold-left and fold-right
Reported by: 	Sven Hartrumpf

Component: Lists

Argument order of "combine" (or "kons") for fold-left differs from the
one for fold-right (and the popular SRFI-1).

A common change in program development is switching from fold-left to
fold-right (or vice versa). With the above inconsistency, such changes
become unnecessarily complex.

Furthermore, many people think of "combine" as "kons", which in
analogy to cons should have the "smaller, one-element" argument first,
and the "larger, all-the-remaining-elements" argument second.
