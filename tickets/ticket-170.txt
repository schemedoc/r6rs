asymmetry between fold-left and fold-right
Reported by: 	Sven Hartrumpf
Version:	5.92

Component: Lists

Argument order of "combine" (or "kons") for fold-left differs from the
one for fold-right (and the popular SRFI-1).

A common change in program development is switching from fold-left to
fold-right (or vice versa). With the above inconsistency, such changes
become unnecessarily complex.

Furthermore, many people think of "combine" as "kons", which in
analogy to cons should have the "smaller, one-element" argument first,
and the "larger, all-the-remaining-elements" argument second.

RESPONSE:

The argument order for the `combine' procedures are consistent with
what the procedures actually do.  It is not clear that supporting
switching from `fold-left' to `fold-right' or vice versa without
regard to the semantic differences between justifies to potential cost
of confusion.

However, the argument order of `fold-left' itself is inconsistent with
the argument order of the `combine' argument.  Hence, `combine' and
`nil' will be reversed in the next draft.
