Formal comment #213 (defect)

defer lambda rather than define rhs when expanding body
Reported by: 	Per Bothner
Version: 	5.92

When expanding a body the current specification defers expanding the
rhs of a define. I suggest it would be more consistent and natural to
defer expanding lambda-expressions instead.

* It improves consistency. Consider:

#|1|# (define VAR (MAC))
#|2|# (set! VAR (MAC))
#|3|# (list (MAC))
#|4|# (MAC)
#|5|# (define VAR (lambda () (MAC)))
#|6|# (set! VAR (lambda () (MAC)))
#|7|# (define-syntax MAC ...)

Which of #1-#6 are valid when followed by #7? By my reading only #1
and #5 are allowed. But that doesn't seem natural to me. If #5 is
allowed, then #6 should be allowed. Similarly for #1 and #2.

In my proposal, #1-#4 are invalid while #5-#6 are valid.

* There are also anomalies with expanding top-level forms. In the
  above example, the expansion of MAC is deferred in #1, #2, #3, but
  not #4. This could lead to subtle differences. In my proposal all of
  these would be expanded eagerly, which removes surprises.

* An informal reason is that this makes the expansion process more
  similar to evaluation: Evaluating define means evaluating its rhs,
  while evaluating a lambda expression does not evaluate its body.

* The above reason leads to better support for read-eval-print loops
  and other interactive modes where expansion is interleaved with
  evaluation: If I type a define in repl, an implementation can defer
  expanding a lambda (until it is called), but it can't defer
  expanding the rhs of a define in general.

RESPONSE:

R5.92RS does not permit expressions to appear before definitions in a
lambda or library body.  So the example given above is invalid even
without any references to MAC except within the body of a top-level
program.  Within the body of a top-level program, expressions that appear
before definitions are treated as dummy definitions.  So #6 and #2 are
already valid; in fact, all but #4 are valid.  Deferring only lambda
expressions, as the comment suggests, rather than all expressions that
appear before definitions and/or on the right-hand sides of variable
definitions, is strictly less general and less consistent than deferring
all such expressions.  Thus, the proposed change has the opposite of the
desired effect.  Therefore, the formal comment is rejected.
