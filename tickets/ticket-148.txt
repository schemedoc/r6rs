Formal comment #148 (defect)

String output ports are even more broken now
Reported by: 	William D Clinger
Version:	5.92

Hidden amongst all the welcome changes to the i/o system were some
less welcome changes to string output ports.

First of all, the open-string-output-port procedure still requires a
useless proc argument.

More importantly, the string ports of version 5.91 were compatible
with the string ports of SRFI 6 in the sense that either could be
implemented in terms of the other with little effort. The string
output ports of version 5.92 are no longer compatible with SRFI 6,
because there is no way to implement the get-output-string procedure
of SRFI 6 using operations of version 5.92.

No rationale for this change has been offered, and the editors' email
discussions (which, SFAIK, are not yet public, else I would cite the
thread that somehow led to this change) contain no serious argument
for it.

I recommend that the operations on string output ports revert to their
specification in version 5.91, modulo corrections, removal of optional
transcoder arguments, and any other changes that may have been made
necessary by improvements to the rest of the i/o system. The editors'
Subversion repository contains a proposal along these lines, and the
editors' email archive contains a correction to that proposal.
