Summary

Slight defect in plausible alist description.

Description

Point 1 does not check that (car x) is a pair as is done in point
3. Suggestion

1) x is a pair, n is 0, and there exists a time t1 in (t0, tf] such
   that (car x) is a pair at time t1.

RESPONSE:

The next draft of the report will address this issue in a manner
consistent with our resolution of formal comment #87.  In particular,
the description of plausible lists and alists may be eliminated
altogether.
