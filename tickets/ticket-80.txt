Correct I/O Interface Inconsistencies

Section: 15.3.5, 15.3.6, 15.4 

Summary

Correct some I/O interface inconsistencies regarding what procedures
are available and where they're located.

Description

There appear to be some funny inconsistencies in the I/O spec. 

In 15.3.6 (Output ports) there's call-with-bytes-output-port and
call-with-string-output-port, but in 15.3.5 (Input ports) there's no
corresponding call-with-bytes-input-port and
call-with-string-input-port.

In 15.3.6 (Output ports) and 15.3.5 (Input ports) there's no
call-with-file-output-port or call-with-file-input-port
(respectively).

In 15.4 (Simple I/O) there's call-with-input-file and
call-with-output-file and with-input-from-file and
with-output-to-file.

Recommendations

Add call-with-input-string and call-with-output-string and
with-input-from-string and with-output-to-string to 15.4. 

Remove call-with-string-output-port from 15.3.6. 

Add call-with-bytes-input-port to 15.3.5 (or, conversely, remove
call-with-bytes-output-port from 15.3.6).

(An alternative would be to have all appropriate call procedures for
files and strings in 15.3.5 and 15.3.6. At least make the choices
consistent.)
