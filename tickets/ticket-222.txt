Formal comment #222 (simplification)

Formal semantics should not contain complicating optimizations

Summary

The current formal semantics contains at least one, and possibly more,
unnecessary performance optimizations that complicate it rather more
than necessary. Such optimizations have no place in a formal
description of the semantics and should be removed.

Description

An example of such an optimization occurs on pages 69 and 70, where
procedure parameters are treated differently depending on whether they
are the target of set! in the body of the procedure. This is
unnecessary. It clashes with the informal description in the body of
the report, and it complicates the semantics with an unnecessary rule
[6appN], and an unnecessary variable assigment metafunction that takes
about 25 lines (more than half of page 70) to describe. Both of these,
and possibly other rules depending on this distinction, should be
removed.

This is one unnecessary complication, presumably based on optimization
considerations, that I noticed. A more careful reading may turn up
other optimization-related complications. This formal comment is
intended to apply to all cases where the formal semantics may be
simplified by discarding optimizations.

SEMANTICS:

The rule is split like that to avoid complicating the semantics when
no assignments happen. The overall goal is to make it easier to follow
along with a reduction sequence and a simple substitution is easier to
follow along with than putting the variable into the store and taking
it back out again.  Moreover, the split makes it clear that variable
mutability can be determined syntactically.
