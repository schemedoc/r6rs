Formal comment #155 (defect)

eq? and eqv? should apply to all standardized objects
Reported by: 	John Cowan
Version:	5.92

Currently, the behavior of eqv? and eq? on records, conditions, ports,
syntax objects, hash tables, and promises is not defined. They should
be treated the same as pairs, vectors, and strings.
