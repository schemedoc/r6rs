Formal comment #155 (defect)

eq? and eqv? should apply to all standardized objects
Reported by: 	John Cowan
Version:	5.92

Currently, the behavior of eqv? and eq? on records, conditions, ports,
syntax objects, hash tables, and promises is not defined. They should
be treated the same as pairs, vectors, and strings.

RESPONSE:

The behavior on records is specified to about the same degree as for
other types, albeit in the chapter on records, not as part of the
core specification of `eq?' and `eqv?'.  The editors will make an
effort to clarify this situation for the next draft, as well as
extending the specification for `eqv?' to other mutable types.

As to immutable types such as syntax objects and conditions, it does
not seem to be in the spirit of `eqv?' to specify the semantics in
those cases: For example, the specification of `eqv?' does not cover
immutable pairs.  A similar arguments can be made for promises.
