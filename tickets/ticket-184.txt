Formal comment #184 (enhancement)

SRFI-39 should be made an R6RS library
Reported by: 	John Cowan
Version:	5.92

I have searched the various status reports and seen nothing about
dynamic binding, dynamic variables, or parameters. I suggest that
SRFI-39 be incorporated into R6RS as the (r6rs parameters) library.

The reason for making parameters part of the standard, beside their
general utility, is that they are intertwingled with the
current-*-port facilities, which are explicitly specified as
parameters by SRFI-39. As a result, it is hard to load a portable
implementation of parameters into a Scheme that doesn't have it;
current-*-port cannot be rebound by parameterize correctly.

Judging by the SRFI-39 mail archives, the only thing controversial
about the final form of the SRFI is the behavior when interacting with
threads. As threads are not part of R6RS, the issue does not arise.

SRFI-39 is already provided by at least Guile, Kawa, Gambit, SISC,
RScheme, scsh, Gauche, STklos, and Chicken.


RESPONSE:

SRFI 39 will not be adopted for R6RS.  It is very late in the R6RS 
development cycle to add such a non-trivial feature, particularly 
one which has some controversial aspects.
