Summary: The overview of Chapter 1 can be read as implying that all
complex arithmetic is exact.

On page 6, in the introductory material of Chapter 1 dealing with
arithmetic, is the following:

"Scheme distinguishes between exact arithmetic, which corresponds to
the mathematical ideal, and inexact arithmetic on
approximations. Exact arithmetic includes arithmetic on integers,
rationals, and complex numbers."

The second sentence in the above passage is ambiguous, and a casual
reading suggests to the reader that all arithmetic on integers,
rationals, and complex numbers is exact. Section 9.9 puts the lie to
that notion, so the report would benefit from the clarification of the
statement. One possibility is the following:

"Candidates for exact arithmetic include integers, rationals, and
complex numbers."
