Formal comment #105 (enhancement)

Scheme is not a scripting language
Reported by:	Arthur A. Gleckler
Priority:	minor 
Milestone:	r6rs
Component:	scripts
Version:	5.91

In <7. Scripts> and throughout the document, use the word "program"
wherever "script" is used now. Scheme is not a "scripting language,"
and there's no reason to use this Unix-specific terminology,
especially given the bad connotations it has.


RESPONSE:

This recommendation has been adopted.  Further details are provided 
in the response to formal comment #51, "Conflating programs and
scripts".
