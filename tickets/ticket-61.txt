Description

According to r6rs, the expression 

  (let ((x #f))
   (let-syntax ((foo (syntax-rules (x)
                       ((_ x y) (define y 'outer))
                       ((_ _ y) (define y 'inner)))))
     (let ()
       (foo x p)
       (define x #f)
       p)))

evaluates to "outer", whereas it would evaluate to "inner" if the
definition preceded (foo x p). This violates lexical scoping.

The following example, in addition to violating lexical scoping

  (let ((x #f))
    (let-syntax ((foo (syntax-rules (x)
                        ((_ x y) (define y 'outer))
                        ((_ _ y) 1))))
      (let ()
        (foo x p)
        (define x #f)
        p)))              ==> outer (wrong)

also violates the spirit (if not the letter) of the first paragraph on
p. 28: "It is a syntax violation if the keyword that identifies one of
the body forms as a definition (derived or core) is redefined by the
same definition or a later definition in the same body."

However, this violation of the spirit will not be detected by the
algorithm described in the same paragraph.

Suggestion

The algorithm described in the first paragraph of p.28 may also have
to record the arguments of each use of free-identifier=?. This is,
however, likely to be expensive.

RESPONSE:

Tracking free-identifier=? calls is indeed potentially expensive and may
cause programs that do not violate either the letter or spirit of the text
to be rejected.  The next draft will include text that prohibits such programs
and say that implementations "should" raise an exception, while keeping
the left-to-right expansion order.  The next draft will also retain the detailed
algorithm description as an example of a possible algorithm, but explain
its limitations.
