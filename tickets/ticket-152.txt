Formal comment #152 (defect)

Inappropriate number of values should be defined sensibly
Reported by: 	John Cowan
Version:	5.92

Report section 9.17, s.v. "values", says that passing an inappropriate
number of values to a continuation is undefined. I believe it ought to
be defined thus:

    If an expression supplies too many values to its continuation, the
    excess values are discarded. If it supplies too few values, the
    deficient values are set to the unspecified value.

In particular, this paves the way to eliminating "the unspecified
value" in favor of simply returning zero values.
