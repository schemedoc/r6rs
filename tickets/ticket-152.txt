Formal comment #152 (defect)

Inappropriate number of values should be defined sensibly
Reported by: 	John Cowan
Version:	5.92

Report section 9.17, s.v. "values", says that passing an inappropriate
number of values to a continuation is undefined. I believe it ought to
be defined thus:

    If an expression supplies too many values to its continuation, the
    excess values are discarded. If it supplies too few values, the
    deficient values are set to the unspecified value.

In particular, this paves the way to eliminating "the unspecified
value" in favor of simply returning zero values.

RESPONSE:

This formal comment was withdrawn by the author, but the editors have
decided to make changes to address the issues underlying the formal
comment, and other related formal comments and discussion posts.

In particular, the expressions specified in the current draft report
to return "the unspecified value" will, in the next draft, be
specified to return an unspecified number of unspecified values.  This
allows implementations to follow R5RS and return a single unspecified
value, as well as to return zero return values and other options.

The next revision of the report will also eliminate "the unspecified
value".
