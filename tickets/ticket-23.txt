Formal comment #23 (defect)

file-options should be a procedure, not syntax
Reported by:	John Cowan
Priority:	minor
Component:	i/o
Version:	5.91

Making file-options a procedure makes it possible to pass a computed
list of symbols. Saving a '(...) wrapper is not sufficient
justification to expose the file-options constructor only as syntax.

This affects 15.2.2 on p. 79.
