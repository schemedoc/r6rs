Formal comment #144 (defect)

The description of the naming convention for condition types is obviously incorrect

On page 22, in section 5.6 (Naming conventions), lies the sentence "By
convention, the names of condition types usually end in '&'." However,
the convention is in fact for them to *begin* with an ampersand, as
can be seen in many places, for example earlier on that same page
("...an exception with condition type &assertion is raised...").
