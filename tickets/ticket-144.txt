Formal comment #144 (defect)

The description of the naming convention for condition types is obviously incorrect
Reported by: 	Jed Davis
Version:	5.92

email: r6rs@jdev.users.panix.com

On page 22, in section 5.6 (Naming conventions), lies the sentence "By
convention, the names of condition types usually end in '&'." However,
the convention is in fact for them to *begin* with an ampersand, as
can be seen in many places, for example earlier on that same page
("...an exception with condition type &assertion is raised...").


RESPONSE:

This will be fixed in the next draft.
