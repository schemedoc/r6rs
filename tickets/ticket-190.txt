Formal comment #190 (defect)

Confusing comparison with Pascal call-by-reference
Reported by: 	Mikael Tillenius
Version: 	5.92


Description

In section 1, top of right column on page 6 of the report, argument
passing is discussed. Quote "Note that call-by-value refers to a
different distinction between by-value and by-reference passing in
Pascal. In Scheme, all data structures are passed by reference." This
seems to imply that Scheme passes arguments similar to how Pascals
call-by-reference. This is not true, for example call-by-reference
would make it possible to implement a procedure "swap" so that a call
"(swap a b)" would swap the values of "a" and "b". 

Proposal

Remove both sentences quoted above, or at least the last one.


RESPONSE:

The next draft of the report will avoid using the terms
"call-by-value" and "call-by-reference".
