Ticket #44 (defect)

'of course' should not be used in the report

Section 1.9 (page 8, right column, just past the first table) reads:

"The ' is, of course, not needed for number or boolean literals"

I think that "of course" should be removed, because a) it is only
obvious for those with a Scheme or Lisp background and b) a language
specification should not make any assumptions about a reader's
knowledge.

RESPONSE:

This will be fixed in the next draft of the report.
