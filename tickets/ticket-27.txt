Ticket #27 (simplification)

Some generic arithmetic procedures should be put in a library
Status: new

I recommend that the library be named (r6rs arithmetic generic). 

As a first cut, I recommend that the following procedures be put
there:

{real,rational,integer}-valued
gcd
lcm
rationalize
sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan
sqrt
expt

RESPONSE:

This recommendation is lacking a clear rationale.  All procedures on
the above list, except for `{real,rational,integer}-valued', were part
of previous versions of the report, presumably because they are used
by many programs performing numerical computations.

The rationale for `{real,rational,integer}-valued' is the subject of
another formal comment.  (Ticket #28.)

Issues:

- We may want to adopt parts of the proposal, but what rationale or
  organizing principle would the new library have?
