Summary

Rename "generate-temporaries" to "generate-symbols" (or, barring that,
"generate-identifiers").

Description

The function generates symbols (or, more specifically,
identifiers). "Temporaries" refers not to the result, but rather to
one possible use of the result. Since the other two terms already have
meaning in Scheme (eg, "symbol?", "identifier?", etc.) it seems like
it would be a good idea to leverage those meanings rather than
introducing a new one.

RESPONSE:

We believe the name is accurate.  The identifiers created by this
procedure are not necessarily useful for anything other than creating new
local bindings, i.e., temporary bindings, in part because there's no
guarantee that the generated identifiers will have names that are distinct
from each other or from existing names.  This should be clarified in the
description, however.
