Summary

Rename "generate-temporaries" to "generate-symbols" (or, barring that,
"generate-identifiers").

Description

The function generates symbols (or, more specifically,
identifiers). "Temporaries" refers not to the result, but rather to
one possible use of the result. Since the other two terms already have
meaning in Scheme (eg, "symbol?", "identifier?", etc.) it seems like
it would be a good idea to leverage those meanings rather than
introducing a new one.
