Formal comment #185 (defect)

The mess around line endings (eol-style and line endings completely unspecified)
Reported by: 	John Cowan
Version:	5.92

One of the components of a transcoder is a symbol called the
eol-style. Standard values of this symbol are lf, cr, crlf, and
ls. There is absolutely no explanation of the purpose of the
eol-style, however. We are left only with the remark that invoking
(newline) is the same as applying write-char to #\linefeed, and with
the explanation of get-line:

    If an end-of-line encoding or line separator is read, then a
    string containing all of the text up to (but not including) the
    end-of-line encoding is returned, and the port is updated to point
    just past the end-of-line encoding or line separator.

It is not clear what an end-of-line encoding is. Is it the one
specified in eol-style? In any case, U+2028 is always recognized as
equivalent to an end-of-line encoding, though it is the one hardly
ever used in the Real World.

Furthermore, line buffering is declared to flush the buffer whenever a
newline or line separator is written to a buffered output port. What
about other separators on other platforms?

I propose the following:

   1. The standard line-ending character within R6RS Scheme is #\linefeed.

   2. The purpose of eol-style is to say how to translate external
      representations of line endings into #\linefeed on input, or
      vice versa on output. Valid symbols for eol-style are 'cr, 'lf,
      'crlf, 'nel, 'crnel, 'ls, and 'none.

   3. On input, the line endings CR, LF, CR+LF, NEL, CR+NEL, and LS
      (U+2028) are all equivalent and are converted to #\linefeed,
      *unless* the eol-style is 'none. This works better in modern
      environments, where (e.g.) Mac OS X systems may have a mixture of
      lf, cr, and (imported from Windows) crlf plain text files. Programs
      which care about the particulars of line ending must use 'none and
      do their own line-end processing. The affected procedures are
      get-char, lookahead-char, get-string-*, get-line (which does not
      return the #\linefeed), get-datum, and read.

   4. On output, #\linefeed characters are converted to the specified
      eol-style, or left alone if eol-style is 'none. The affected
      procedures are put-char, put-string-*, put-datum, write-char,
      newline, display, and write.

   5. Line buffering is made implementation-dependent (it will be anyhow). 

I also take this opportunity to point out that single-line comments
with ; should terminate at the first line ending rather than the first
linefeed, and that a line ending within a Scheme string literal should
become a single #\linefeed character (as if \n had been
written). Getting this right requires the above definition of line
ending to be added to the lexical syntax.

DRAFT RESPONSE:

The suggestions of this comment will be adopted in the next
draft.

****************************************************************

Will strongly recommends adoption of this comment's proposal.
He also recognizes that, having argued for some of these things
during previous discussions, to no avail, his recommendation
means diddley-squat.
