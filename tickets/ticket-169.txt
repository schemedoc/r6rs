Formal comment #169 (defect)

confusion about which bytevectors exist
Reported by: 	Sven Hartrumpf
Version:	5.92

Page 5: "It deals only with integers ..." But at the end of section 2
there are functions for IEEE-754 numbers.

Page 5: The explanation of bytevector-fill! talks about "vector" which
should be "bytevector".

A heading for 64-bit integers is missing, and the heading for 2.6 is
at the wrong place.


RESPONSE:

Agreed.  The suggested changes will be made in the next draft.
