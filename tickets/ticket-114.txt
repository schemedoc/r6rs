identifier macros with syntax-rules
Reported by:	David Van Horn

Component:	macros
Version:	5.91

Summary

It should be possible to define identifier macros using only the base
library. Description

The (r6rs syntax-case) library allows for identifier macros to be
defined, however their specification is orthogonal to both
non-hygienic macro expansion and the ability to evaluate arbitrary
Scheme code at expansion time, thus it should be possible to define
identifier macros in terms of syntax-rules. This implies extending the
<srpattern> production to include an underscore, having syntax-rules
forms evaluate to transformers, and moving make-variable-transformer
to the base library.

RESPONSE:

The editors agree that adding the ability to define variable transformers
to the base library is a good idea but have decided to solve the problem
by making identifier-syntax part of the base library rather than by
extending syntax-rules and adding make-variable-transformer.
