Ticket #114 (enhancement)

identifier macros with syntax-rules
Status: new	Reported by:	David Van Horn	Assigned to:	dyb

Summary

It should be possible to define identifier macros using only the base
library. Description

The (r6rs syntax-case) library allows for identifier macros to be
defined, however their specification is orthogonal to both
non-hygienic macro expansion and the ability to evaluate arbitrary
Scheme code at expansion time, thus it should be possible to define
identifier macros in terms of syntax-rules. This implies extending the
<srpattern> production to include an underscore, having syntax-rules
forms evaluate to transformers, and moving make-variable-transformer
to the base library.

Discussion

Currently ...-list->bytes and bytes->...list procedures are supplied
to convert bytes vectors to lists of numbers and back. However, where
one has the choice, programming with lists of numbers tend to be less
efficient than programming with vectors of numbers.

It may be useful to supply ...-vector->bytes and ...-bytes->vector
procedures in addition to, or maybe preferably instead of, the
list-based procedures. Since these can be implemented extremely
efficiently, it seems a pity not to provide them.

DRAFT RESPONSE:

Agreed.
