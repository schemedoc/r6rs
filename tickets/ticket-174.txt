Formal comment #174 (defect)


No defaults given for sealed and opaque
Status: closed (worksforme)
Reported by: 	Andre van Tonder
Version:	5.92

Pages : 15-18

Description

In the explicit and implicit naming syntactic layers, it is not stated
what the default values for sealedness and opaqueness will be if the
corresponding clauses are absent.

Suggestion

Specify default values of #f for sealed? and (probably the safer
option) #t for opaque?


RESPONSE:

The 5.92 draft actually does specify defaults implicitly (non-sealed
and non-opaque).  The editors will attempt to clarify the wording.
