Formal comment #91 (defect)

inf.0 and nan.0 should remain symbols
Reported by:	William D Clinger
Priority:	trivial
Milestone:	r6rs
Component:	lexicalsyntax
Version:	5.91

According to the formal grammar that is spread over pages 11 through
15 of the draft R6RS, inf.0 and nan.0 are external representations of
numbers as well as symbols. That syntactic ambiguity is undesirable,
has no stated rationale, and creates a gratuitous incompatibility with
the R5RS, in which both inf.0 and nan.0 are symbols.

Furthermore the draft R6RS neglects to define or to constrain the
numerical interpretation of inf.0 and nan.0.

I recommend that inf.0 and nan.0 remain symbols in the R6RS.

RESPONSE:

A future revision of the report will reflect the recommendation.
