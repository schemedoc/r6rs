C sharp can pass arguments by reference
Status: new
Reported by: 	Bob Burger

Summary

1. C sharp can pass arguments by reference using the ref
   keyword.

2. The language is not C hash, but C$\sharp$ in LaTeX.

Description

There are three uses of C# in the base report, all on page 6. The
sentence on the top of the second column of page 6 says that C# always
passes arguments by value. In C#, arguments may be passed by value
using the ref keyword.


RESPONSE:

The next draft of the report will avoid using the "by-value"
terminology.
