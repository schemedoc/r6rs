Summary

In section 3.2.5, the word "parenthesized" incorrectly
appears in a monospace font. 

Description

In section 3.2.5, in the description of what is represented by the
character sequence #\((x), the text "followed by another datum,
parenthesized x" appears as a comment; the word
"parenthesized" is incorrectly (and incongruously with the
rest of the section) typeset in a monospace font. Because this word
does not represent a literal datum, it should be typeset in a roman
font, with the "x" being kept monospace.
