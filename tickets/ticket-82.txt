Summary

Change the "for" import syntax in libraries to make it easier to read. 
Description

In section 6.1 a library <import spec> is defined to be one of: 
        <import set>
        (for <import set> <import phase> ...)

In section 6.4 an example uses the "for" syntax: 
        (library (my-helpers values-stuff)
                (export mvlet)
                (import r6rs (for (my-helpers id-stuff) expand))
                ...)

The "for" syntax is already somewhat difficult to read since it places
an identifier--in this case a compound identifier--in the middle of an
English phrase. Unfortunately, it can get worse; an import set can
contain nested clauses such as "only", "except", "add-prefix", and
"rename" pushing the import phase even further from the "for":

        (library (my-helpers values-stuff)
                (export mvlet)
                (import r6rs (for (add-prefix (my-helpers id-stuff) mh-id:) expand))
                ...)

It becomes more difficult to read such syntax than it needs to
be.

Recommendation

The "for" clause can place the import phase(s) immediately after the "for": 
        (for <import phase> ... <import set>)

I think that makes the examples easier to read:

        (library (my-helpers values-stuff)
                (export mvlet)
                (import r6rs (for expand (my-helpers id-stuff)))
                ...)

        (library (my-helpers values-stuff)
                (export mvlet)
                (import r6rs (for expand (add-prefix (my-helpers id-stuff) mh-id:)))
                ...)

The underlying implementation may or may not be marginally more
difficult, but if it is I think the effort is worth the trade-off.

Anoher variant on this idea is: 
        (for <import phases> <import set>)

Where <import phases> (note the plural) is: 
        <import phase>
        (<import phase> ...)

For multiple import phases that would end up looking like this: 
        (library (my-helpers values-stuff)
                (export mvlet)
                (import r6rs (for (expand run) (add-prefix (my-helpers id-stuff) mh-id:)))
                ...)

(The fact that a "meta" import phase is represented as a list may make
this undesirable.)

RESPONSE:

The current "for" syntax is more consistent with other clauses, such
as "rename", where the library specification comes first. While
conceding that it may be sometimes difficult to read, we intend to
keep the current syntax in the interest of consistency.
