Summary

Change the "for" import syntax in libraries to make it easier to read. 
Description

In section 6.1 a library <import spec> is defined to be one of: 
        <import set>
        (for <import set> <import phase> ...)

In section 6.4 an example uses the "for" syntax: 
        (library (my-helpers values-stuff)
                (export mvlet)
                (import r6rs (for (my-helpers id-stuff) expand))
                ...)

The "for" syntax is already somewhat difficult to read since it places
an identifier--in this case a compound identifier--in the middle of an
English phrase. Unfortunately, it can get worse; an import set can
contain nested clauses such as "only", "except", "add-prefix", and
"rename" pushing the import phase even further from the "for":

        (library (my-helpers values-stuff)
                (export mvlet)
                (import r6rs (for (add-prefix (my-helpers id-stuff) mh-id:) expand))
                ...)

It becomes more difficult to read such syntax than it needs to
be.

Recommendation

The "for" clause can place the import phase(s) immediately after the "for": 
        (for <import phase> ... <import set>)

I think that makes the examples easier to read:

        (library (my-helpers values-stuff)
                (export mvlet)
                (import r6rs (for expand (my-helpers id-stuff)))
                ...)

        (library (my-helpers values-stuff)
                (export mvlet)
                (import r6rs (for expand (add-prefix (my-helpers id-stuff) mh-id:)))
                ...)

The underlying implementation may or may not be marginally more
difficult, but if it is I think the effort is worth the trade-off.

Anoher variant on this idea is: 
        (for <import phases> <import set>)

Where <import phases> (note the plural) is: 
        <import phase>
        (<import phase> ...)

For multiple import phases that would end up looking like this: 
        (library (my-helpers values-stuff)
                (export mvlet)
                (import r6rs (for (expand run) (add-prefix (my-helpers id-stuff) mh-id:)))
                ...)

(The fact that a "meta" import phase is represented as a list may make
this undesirable.)
