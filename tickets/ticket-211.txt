Formal comment #211 (simplification)

Remove the (r6rs when-unless) library
Reported by: 	Mike Sperber
Version: 	5.92

R6RS component: (r6rs when-unless)

Summary: (r6rs when-unless) should be removed

This is mainly an attempt to stimulate discussion: Given that when and
unless offer little advantage over just using if, and given that their
definitions are so trivial, it's unclear whether the benefit of having
a separate library with these in the standard is worth the cost. As I
don't use when and unless, it's clear that they're not worth the cost
to me. I wonder what others think.

RESPONSE:

A majority of the editors have decided to keep `when' and `unless'.
However, they will be moved to a new (r6rs control) library, which
will also contain `case-lambda' (thus eliminating the (r6rs
case-lambda) library) and `do', which will be moved from the (r6rs
base) library.
