Drop formal semantics of library toplevel

Summary

Formal semantics of library toplevel is meaningless, unnecessary and
clashes with the description in the body of the document. It should be
removed.

Description

The formal description of the library semantics unnecessarily adds
significant volume to the formal semantics. It is also inconsistent
with the informal description of the library semantics and "expansion
process" described in the body of the document.

According to the description in the text, a library residualizes to
the equivalent of a LETREC* expression. Therefore

   1. Its semantics can be reduced to that of LAMBDA.

   2. Because of (1), the formal semantics for libraries is redundant
      and should be removed.

   3. Even worse, the formal semantics for libraries is
      meaningless. It purports to give a semantics to DEFINE
      forms. However, an expanded library contains no DEFINEs, just a
      LETREC*.

Suggestion

Remove the formal semantics of libraries. It should be sufficient to
include a note that since libraries expand to LETREC*, their semantics
can be understood in terms of LAMBDA.
