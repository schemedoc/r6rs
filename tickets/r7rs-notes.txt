R7RS suggestions:

Missing type predicates:

  enum-set?
  environment?
  record-constructor-descriptor?

Missing equality predicates:

  enum-type=?
  record-type-descriptor=?

  The latter should be referenced in the description of eqv?

Extensions:

  environment should accept zero or more import specs, just as
  import contains zero or more import specs.

  standard-input-port, standard-output-port, and standard-error-port
  should take optional buffer-mode and maybe-transcoder arguments.
  the latter is just a convenience, but there's no existing way to
  specify a buffer mode for these ports.

  enumerations should not be limited to symbols.

Custom port notes:

  there's no way to set the position properly for a write after a
  lookahead on a custom binary input/output port unless working
  get-position and set-position procedures are provided when the port is
  created.

  this problem is worse for custom textual input and custom textual
  input/output ports, because even if working get-position and
  set-position procedures are provided, there's no way to adjust the
  position reported by get-position to account for the buffered lookahead
  character (or other characters buffered for efficiency), given that
  positions may not be represented as a sequence of integer values.

  it's also unclear whether an eof object occupies a character position,
  which affects the position calculation.  the report appears to suggest
  that eof objects are discrete elements of the input stream, but problems
  arise if eof does occupy character positions for finite streams ending
  in an infinite sequence of eof objects, including custom ports
  ultimately based on finite files.

  a possible set of fixes for would be (1) to add an
  "elements-currently-buffered" argument to a custom port's get-position
  procedure that it can use to report an accurate position, (2) to require
  working get-position and set-position procedures for custom input/output
  ports, and (3) to declare that "buffered" eof objects (i.e., those
  detected port-eof?  or lookahead) take up no byte or character
  positions.
