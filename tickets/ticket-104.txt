Formal comment #104 (enhancement)

Add bytes-fill! procedure analogous to vector-fill!
Reported by:	Arthur A. Gleckler

Component:	bytes
Version:	5.91

In <11. Bytes objects>, there should be a bytes-fill! procedure
analogous to vector-fill! . One provided by the implementation could
be much faster than one implemented using basic byte operations. An
unoptimized implementation would be trivial to write. If there is no
such procedure, there shouldn't be a vector-fill! .

RESPONSE:

A `bytes-fill!' procedure will be added in a future revision of draft,
as proposed.
