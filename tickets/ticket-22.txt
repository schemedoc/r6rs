Formal comment #22 (defect)

U+0085 is whitespace
Reported by:	John Cowan
Assigned to:	mflatt
Priority:	minor
Component:	unicode
Version:	5.91

The character U+0085 is the conventional Unicode equivalent of the
EBCDIC NEL character, used as a line separator on EBCDIC-based
systems. It should be whitespace to Scheme.

RESPONSE:

Agreed. U+0085 will be a whitespace character in the next draft of the
report.
