Minor "typos" in section 20.3

Component: Other (20.3. Delayed Evaluation) 

At the end of the `delay' description, there is a sentence that says:
"See the description of `force' (section 20.3)" and there is a similar
reference in force' to the delay' section. It's a little awkward to
have references include the section number when the reference is to
the next or previous paragraph. (I don't remember now if this happens
elsewhere too.)

Also, the sample implementation is still using a procedural value for
no good reason, now that it is possible to make a new record type.

RESPONSE:

The sentence in question will be elided in the next draft revision of
the report.

It is unclear what advantages an implementation using a new record
type would have over the one currently in the draft.
