Description

The report conflates three orthogonal issues - defining a program,
marking the entry point of the program, and marking the program as one
particular kind of Scheme program on one particular operating system
in one particular use case, a use case that, by many Schemers, is not
commonly needed, if at all.

The current report is allowing this one use case to strongly biase the
way Scheme programs are supposed to be organised in files. Although it
is not required by the report, implementations are likely to satisfy
it by requiring the "main" part of the program (in the script) to be
in a separate file from the rest, even when it makes no logical
organizational sense to do this.

An existence proof: Many current Schemes allows one to write portable
programs that will run on various operating systems, including Unix,
without having to include any operating-system specific details in the
text of the program.

A more common use case for many is compiling a program to an
executable binary. These do not require a scheme-script executable to
run, nor do they require special directives to satisfy an
infrastructure requirement for use case they do not need on one
particular operating system. The report therefore burdens, and
discriminates against, compiler-only implementations by requiring them
to provide unneeded facilities.

Presumably the intent of the authors is that a file containing a
script can be dropped without modification onto any system and will
just work. But the report states that the first line may contain
something else, and should be ignored. The report also does not
explicitly require the script part of a program to be in a separate
file, nor the #! directive to be on the first line of such a
file. However, in these cases, presumably it will not portably run on
Unix. In other words, the report blesses non-portable programs. What
is then the point of going to the trouble of specifying something in
the interest of portablity if it does not guarantee portability.

Marking the interpreter as part of the program text is an
idiosyncratic practice particular to unix scripts, conflating
orthogonal concerns. The Unix design is not necessarily a particularly
good design. It should not be adopted and blessed by the Scheme
report.

A large number of current and future Schemers do not often, if ever,
use Unix. Suggestion

Consider providing a definition of Scheme programs either instead of,
or in addition to, scripts, or modify the script specification by
removing the <script header> and most of the substance of 7.1.1., in a
way that does not accomodate, bless or otherwise favour a particular
use case on a particular operating system. Allow programs to consist
of libraries and entry point in the same contiguous text.
