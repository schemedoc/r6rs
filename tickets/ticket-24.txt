Ticket #24 (defect)

U+FFFD is not meant for encoding errors.
Status: closed (invalid)
Reported by:	John Cowan

Priority:	minor
Component:	i/o

The Unicode character U+FFFD is intended to represent a character in a
non-Unicode encoding which is not representable within Unicode as
currently defined. It is not intended to represent an encoding error.

The Plan 9 OS uses U+0080, which has no Unicode or ISO defined
meaning, to represent encoding errors. I suggest it.

This affects error-handling-code in 15.3.3 (p. 87).
