Formal comment #192 (defect)

Bytevectors: Sections 2.5 and 2.6 are inappropriately structured
Reported by: 	Ludovic Courtès
Version: 	5.92

Section 2.5 of the [Libraries] report (page 8) is entitled "Operations
on 32-bit integers" but contains operations on 32-bit and 64-bit
integers, as well as operations on IEEE-754 simple-precision floating
point numbers. Section 2.6 contains the remaining operations on
IEEE-754 numbers, but operations on simple-precision and
double-precision numbers are interleaved, which makes the section hard
to follow.

I would suggest creating a section "Operations on 64-bit integers"
containing the relevant operations, followed by a section entitled
"Operations on IEEE-754 floating-point numbers" containing all the
IEEE-754-related procedures, starting with simple-precision and going
on with double-precision.

RESPONSE:

The suggestion will adopted in the next revision of the report.
