Ticket #18 (defect)

String exit codes should be allowed

In the Plan 9 and Limbo operating systems, process exit codes are
strings. Furthermore, in Posix systems, the legal exit codes are the
exact integers 0-255 rather than any exact integer; on VMS, IIRC, any
32-bit non-negative integer is allowed.

Scheme should allow scripts to return any externally representable
value, with a note that the external environment will probably only be
able to handle a limited range of values.

This affects section 7 (p. 26).


RESPONSE:

Per the response to formal comment #51, "Conflating programs and 
scripts", the specification for scripts will be moved into a 
non-normative appendix.

Comment (#18) will be addressed by the specification of a new 
condition type in the scripts appendix.  This condition type will 
allow both string and numeric exit codes to be provided, along 
the lines described in the following message:
