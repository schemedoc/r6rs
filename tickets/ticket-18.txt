Formal comment #18 (defect)

String exit codes should be allowed
Reported by:	John Cowan

Component:	scripts
Version:	5.91

In the Plan 9 and Limbo operating systems, process exit codes are
strings. Furthermore, in Posix systems, the legal exit codes are the
exact integers 0-255 rather than any exact integer; on VMS, IIRC, any
32-bit non-negative integer is allowed.

Scheme should allow scripts to return any externally representable
value, with a note that the external environment will probably only be
able to handle a limited range of values.

This affects section 7 (p. 26).

RESPONSE:

Per the response to formal comment #51, "Conflating programs and 
scripts", the specification for scripts will be moved into a 
non-normative appendix.

To address comment #18, that appendix may specify an exit code 
mechanism that handles both integer and string exit codes.
