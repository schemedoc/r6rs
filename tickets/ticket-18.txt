Ticket #18 (defect)

String exit codes should be allowed

In the Plan 9 and Limbo operating systems, process exit codes are
strings. Furthermore, in Posix systems, the legal exit codes are the
exact integers 0-255 rather than any exact integer; on VMS, IIRC, any
32-bit non-negative integer is allowed.

Scheme should allow scripts to return any externally representable
value, with a note that the external environment will probably only be
able to handle a limited range of values.

This affects section 7 (p. 26).


RESPONSE:

This comment will be addressed by the addition of a new condition 
type, which will allow both string and numeric exit codes to be 
specified, along the lines described in the following message:
