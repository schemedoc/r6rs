It need not break closure. Flonums represent members of the union of
real numbers and NaNs?.

Okay -- I shouldn't have extended this to fl operations. So the text:

should be retracted from #11.

Then fl<, fl>, fl<=, fl>=, etc. would accept +nan.0 as an argument,
while the generic operations <, >, <=, >=, etc. would not. Thus fl
operations would retain efficient implementation.

Generic arithmetic (+, -, *, /) performance is not degraded by
comparison operators rejecting NaNs?, but by the possibility of
receiving non-real numbers, as can be returned by irrational
functions.

The fl versions of irrational functions can always return flonums
(including NaNs?).

This same reasoning also argues against having complex non-real
numbers. Supporting more numeric types necessarily creates interface
issues with lesser languages.

Use of the fl function-set can guarantee interoperability.

Formal comment #11 says nothing about (= +nan.0 +nan.0) !

The fl versions of comparison operators can be IEEE-754 compatible
without burdening generic comparison operators with behavior which
extends poorly to complex number systems.


RESPONSE:

The R6RS speaks of NaNs because the usual representations
of inexact real numbers are based on the IEEE standards
for binary floating point arithmetic.  Those standards
approximate real arithmetic, using NaNs as error results
when a rational approximation or infinity would be
misleading.

The R6RS could define its own notion of a complex-NaN
that is not considered to be real, but values such as
+nan.0+nan.0i and +nan.0+45i serve that purpose already.

The proposal claims that performance would not suffer,
but we are not persuaded.  In current practice, the
representations of real numbers are usually disjoint
from those of non-real complex numbers, and the generic
arithmetic dispatch exploits this fact.  If NaNs were
regarded as non-real but represented like reals, then
generic operations that require real arguments would
be slowed by the need to detect and to reject NaNs.
If NaNs were regarded as non-real and represented as
non-real, then every result of a flonum operation
would have to be examined to see whether it is a NaN,
and converted to non-real representation if it is.

Treating the NaN result of a flonum computation as a
complex but not real number would reduce effectiveness
of flow analysis, which would also make generic arithmetic
slower.  Currently, the flonum operations always return
a real.  Under the proposal, flonum operations would be
capable of returning non-reals (the NaNs), which would
destroy the primary closure property that flow analysis
exploits when optimizing mixed flonum and generic
arithmetic.

For all of these reasons, the editors believe it is better
to treat NaN as a real but not rational number.
