Having 3 different comment syntaxes (four, if you count #!) is
overkill. #;<datum> adds no expressive power, and is dangerous, and
should be removed.

#;<datum> is always equivalent to #|<datum>|#. It saves two
characters, at the cost of making it harder to see where the comment
ends. The expressed rationale is to make it easy to comment out
sections of code - but it only makes sense to use it during
development/debugging. In "production" code or anything else
supposed to be maintainable you clearly should use #|...|# instead
since it is much safer and clearer exactly what is commented
out. And during development/debugging you can use an editor/IDE
which can just as easily enclude code in #|...|# comments.

Furthermore, #|<datum>|# is strictly more powerful, since it can
comment out not just a single <datum> but as many as you want.

#; is the sort of "save two characters" "feature" which is not
appropriate in a Scheme standard.

RESPONSE:

We remain more convinced by the arguments in favor of `#;',
particularly that it allows a programmer to clearly communicate the
commenting out of a single expression (as opposed to a line or block
of arbitrary text).

Since one purpose of the standard is to foster communication in terms
of code, it is appropriate for R6RS to standardize `#;'.
