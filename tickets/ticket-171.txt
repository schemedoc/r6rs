Formal comment #171 (simplification)

verbosity of "fields" specifications for records
Reported by: 	Sven Hartrumpf
Version:	5.92

The markers "immutable" and "mutable" in <field-spec> are redundant
because the two cases can be easily distinguished by checking for 2 or
3 values.


RESPONSE:

The editors tried to design the syntax in such a way as to enable
future extensions to the syntax of <field-spec> that specify further
attributes of fields.  Depending on the number of subforms of
<field-spec> for identification would make this more difficult.  It
would be possible to circumvent the problem by adding more
parentheses.  However, as some editors felt the proposal already had
too many parentheses as it stands, the current syntax was adopted.
