Subject: [Formal] Integer division examples should be written in Scheme.

	         submitter's name: Aubrey Jaffer
		    type of issue: Defect
		         priority: Minor
		   R6RS component: 9.8.3 Semantics of common operations
	    version of the report: 5.94
one-sentence summary of the issue: 

Integer division examples should be written in Scheme.

    full description of the issue:

Section 9.8 Generic arithmetic discusses both Scheme and mathematics.
In order to prevent confusion about context, mathematical formulas
should be written using conventional (infix) mathematical notation,
while Scheme expressions should be written using Scheme notation.

But the examples of Scheme functions in "Integer division" are not
written in Scheme:

   123 div 10  =  12
   123 mod 10  =  3
   ...

Scheme calls in sections labeled "Examples" should be written in
Scheme:

   (div 123 10)   ==> 12
   (mod 123 10)   ==> 3
   ...

If an editor finds Scheme syntax too ugly to use, then that editor is
working on the wrong project!


RESPONSE:

The operations for integer division are first defined mathematically
(similarly to other definitions such as that of log), and the
semantics of the Scheme procedures is then defined in terms of the
mathematical definitions.
