one-sentence summary of the issue: 

Integer division examples should be written in Scheme.

    full description of the issue:

Section 9.8 Generic arithmetic discusses both Scheme and mathematics.
In order to prevent confusion about context, mathematical formulas
should be written using conventional (infix) mathematical notation,
while Scheme expressions should be written using Scheme notation.

But the examples of Scheme functions in "Integer division" are not
written in Scheme:

   123 div 10  =  12
   123 mod 10  =  3
   ...

Scheme calls in sections labeled "Examples" should be written in
Scheme:

   (div 123 10)   ==> 12
   (mod 123 10)   ==> 3
   ...

If an editor finds Scheme syntax too ugly to use, then that editor is
working on the wrong project!
