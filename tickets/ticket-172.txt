Formal comment #172 (simplification)

"Whitespace and newlines" = whitespace

Summary

Since newlines are whitespace characters, the phrase "whitespace and
newlines" is redundant.

Description

In the last paragraph of section 1.2 (Expressions), the phrase
"whitespace and newlines" is redundant and possibly misleading, since
newlines are whitespace characters. I propose that the paragraph be
revised to read as follows:

    As in many other languages, whitespace separating subexpressions
    of an expression is not significant. Programmers often use it,
    informally, to indicate structure.

One could insert the parenthetical phrase "(including newlines)" after
the word "whitespace" if the point it makes seems important.


RESPONSE:

Agreed.  The suggested change will be made in the next draft.
