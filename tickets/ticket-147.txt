Formal comment #147 (defect)

Nothing is said to be safe
Reported by: 	William D Clinger
Version:	5.92

The safety guarantees of section 4.5 hold only for programs and
libraries that are "said to be safe". Since the meaning of that phrase
is not defined within the report, and no programs and libraries are
explicitly alleged to be safe, the safety guarantees of 4.5 are
meaningless.

Comparison with 5.91 shows that the first paragraph of section 4.5 was
dropped in 5.92.

Section 4.5 should be either dropped in its entirety or revised so it
actually says something.

RESPONSE:

In the next draft, section 4.5 will clarify the notion of "safe
library" and "safe program".
