Formal comment #86 (defect)

Legal libraries cannot be imported
Reported by:	Andre Van Tonder
Priority:	minor
Milestone:	r6rs
Component:	presentation
Version:	5.91

Summary: 

The <import spec> syntax disallows some legally definable libraries
from being imported.

Description: 

Libraries with names like

(only foo bar), (except foo bar), (rename foo), (for foo expand), (for foo run), (add-prefix foo bar) 

can be legally defined. However, the current <import spec> syntax
makes it impossible to import them. For example, since "the ambiguity
should be resolved in favor of the interpretation of the name as
library syntax", the following cannot be used to import the above
libraries:

(import (only foo bar) 

(except foo bar) (rename foo) ...) 

Suggestion: 

Either 

- Make library names single identifiers (as argued already in another
  formal comment), or

- Drop the (single-identifier) -> single-dentifier shorthand of the
  current spec.

RESPONSE:

We agree to drop the unparenthesized shorthand.
