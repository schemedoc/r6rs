Formal comment #121 (defect)

Instances of acos are missing
Reported by:	Alan Watson
Assigned to:	will
Priority:	minor
Component:	arithmetic
Version:	5.91

Instances of acos are missing from the functions listed in 16.4
(flacos) and 16.6 (inexact-acos).

RESPONSE:

The `flacos' procedure will be added in the next revision of the
report.  The inexact-arithmetic library will be deleted in the next
revision of the report; hence, this part of the comment will not
apply anymore.
