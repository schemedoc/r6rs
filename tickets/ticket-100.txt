Formal comment #100 (defect)

forall should be for-all for consistency with for-each
Reported by:	Arthur A. Gleckler
Priority:	minor

Component:	other
Version:	5.91

In <12. List utilities>, please change the name of forall to
for-all. This is consistent with for-each, and "forall" is not an
English word in any case.

RESPONSE:

The suggested change has been approved.  The 'forall' procedure
has been renamed to 'for-all'.
