Ticket #100 (defect)

forall should be for-all for consistency with for-each
Status: new	Reported by:	Arthur A. Gleckler	Assigned to:	anton
Priority:	minor	Milestone:	r6rs
Component:	other	Version:	5.91

In <12. List utilities>, please change the name of forall to
for-all. This is consistent with for-each, and "forall" is not an
English word in any case.

RESPONSE:

The suggested change has been approved.  The 'forall' procedure has been renamed to
'for-all'.
