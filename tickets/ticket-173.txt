Formal comment #173 (defect)

Section 1.5: (f 23) is 65, not 42
Reported by: 	John David Stone
Version:	5.92
Summary

In section 1.5, (f 23) is 65, not 42.

Description

In the paragraph following the second display in section 1.5
(Procedures), it is incorrectly asserted that (f 23) evaluates to
42. I propose that the last word of the paragraph be changed from "42"
to "65".


RESPONSE:

This will be fixed in the next draft of the report.
