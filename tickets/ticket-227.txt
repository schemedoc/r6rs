Summary

DEFINE and BEGINF have no place in the formal semantics, needlessly
complicate the latter, and should be removed.

Description

According to the description of the expansion process in chapter 8, a
fully expanded Scheme program will not contain any occurrences of
DEFINE or BEGINF, /not even at program or library toplevel/.

For this reason, including these as primitives in the formal semantics
does not add any value to the formal semantics. It just needlessly
complicates and bloats it (a lot).  Suggestion

Remove DEFINE and BEGINF from formal semantics.
