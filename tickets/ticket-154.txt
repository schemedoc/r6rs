At present, the only self-evaluating datums are numbers, booleans,
characters, and strings, as noted in report section 6.3. This list is
fundamentally historical.

There is no principled reason why other kinds of datums, such as the
empty list, vectors, and bytevectors should not be
self-evaluating. Let's make them so.
