Datums should be self-evaluating generally
Reported by: 	John Cowan
Version: 	5.92

At present, the only self-evaluating datums are numbers, booleans,
characters, and strings, as noted in report section 6.3. This list is
fundamentally historical.

There is no principled reason why other kinds of datums, such as the
empty list, vectors, and bytevectors should not be
self-evaluating. Let's make them so.

RESPONSE:

In the current draft, parentheses (or brackets) always mark a compound
form where the first subform identifies the operator.  Making () a
literal would destroy this property.  Generally, Scheme has often
favored uniformity over convenience, which is also why vector and
bytevector datums are not literals.
