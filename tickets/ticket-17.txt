Ticket #17 (defect)

"An exception might be raised" considered confusing

I believe it would be more appropriate to use "An exception should not
be raised" in accordance with the definition of SHOULD NOT in RFC
2119. This affects the definition in Section 5.5 (p. 20) as well as
all uses.

If this is thought confusing, then "may (but should not) be raised" is
probably clearer, though more verbose.

It would be good to go through and make all MUSTard RFC
2119-compliant, though one need not use the IETF all-caps convention.
