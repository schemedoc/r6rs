Subject: [Formal] Make bytevectors self-evaluating in library spec

Submitter: Hyungrok Kim
Issue type: Defect
Priority: Minor
Component: Syntax
Report version: 5.94
Summary: Make bytevectors self-evaluating in library spec

Formal comment #154 made bytevectors self-evaluating, and this change
has been implemented in R5.94RS section 3.3.4. However, the R5.94RS
library report says that

    Like list and vector literals, literals representing bytevec-
    tors must be quoted:

       '#vu8(12 23 123)     ==> #vu8(12 23 123)

This should be corrected.


RESPONSE:

This was an editorial oversight, and has been corrected.
