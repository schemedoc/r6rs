Summary: Library names should be made consistent

Currently, the library names in R5.94RS are somewhat inconsistent. The
majority of names that refer to a single "data type" do so in the plural
(e.g., 'hashtables', 'lists', 'mutable-pairs'), whereas a few others do
so in the singular (e.g., 'bytevector', 'enum'), and one, 'arithmetic
fx', is an abbreviation.

I propose, for consistency, changing the following library names:

    arithmetic flonum   =>  arithmetic flonums
    arithmetic fx       =>  arithmetic fixnums
    bytevector          =>  bytevectors
    enum                =>  enums (or enumerations)


RESPONSE:

These changes have been made.
