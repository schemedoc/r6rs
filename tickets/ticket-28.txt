From what I can make out from the examples, the *-valued? procedures
return #t if the number has an imaginary part of inexact zero, (where
real?, rational?, and integer? all rightly return #f), and
real-valued? in particular returns #f on NaN (where real? returns #t).

What are these procedures for? R6RS should say.
