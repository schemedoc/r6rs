From what I can make out from the examples, the *-valued? procedures
return #t if the number has an imaginary part of inexact zero, (where
real?, rational?, and integer? all rightly return #f), and
real-valued? in particular returns #f on NaN (where real? returns #t).

What are these procedures for? R6RS should say.

RESPONSE:

The `*-valued' procedures check whether a given number can be coerced
to the specified type without loss of numerical information.  This is
more closely related to the type information a program might require
of a number than the "regular" numerical predicates, whose behavior is
motivated by closure properties designed to enable efficient
implementation.

Issues:

- `real-valued?' should return #t on +nan.0.
