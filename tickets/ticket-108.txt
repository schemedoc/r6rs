Formal comment #108 (enhancement)

In <field-spec>s of define-record-type, field name should appear first
Reported by:	Arthur A. Gleckler

Component:	records

In <13.2. Explicit-naming syntactic layer>, it would be best if the
field name, not whether it was mutable, appeared first in each
<field-spec>. That would make manually scanning the list of fields
faster.

RESPONSE:

(mutable var ---) is more in the spirit of Scheme's prefix syntax than
(var mutable ---).  Also, it is not clear to us that placing the
mutable/immutable keyword first actually inhibits manually scanning for
the field name in a significant way.  In the implicit naming layer, one
has only to scan for "var)", and in the explicit naming layer, the fields
are likely to be listed on separate lines, where the vars can easily be
lined up.
