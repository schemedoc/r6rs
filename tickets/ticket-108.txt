Ticket #108 (enhancement)

In <field-spec>s of define-record-type, field name should appear first

In <13.2. Explicit-naming syntactic layer>, it would be best if the
field name, not whether it was mutable, appeared first in each
<field-spec>. That would make manually scanning the list of fields
faster.
