Summary

No rationale is given for having the library (r6rs enum) in the
report. Unless there is a compelling rationale, it is suggested that
the library be dropped.

Description

In the absence of a rationale, it is difficult to judge whether this
library is really essential. In contrast to most of the other
libraries included in the report,

I do not think enumerations were part of the r6rs mandate.

there does not seem to be a general feeling in the community that
enumerations are essential and should be standardized. it is unclear
what sets enumerations apart from a whole plethora of excluded
possible libraries that may have been as useful or more useful. there
is no widespread prior usage experience of enumerations. it seems to
be an ad hoc encapsulation of accidental functionality used in the
implementation of other libraries.

I do not personally know a sufficiently strong reason to include this
library in the report. I do not deny that enumerations may be useful,
but since the report is already regarded by many as too large, perhaps
this library might be profitably excised. Suggestion

Perhaps drop this library. Alternatively, it may be helpful to provide
a compelling rationale for including it.
