Summary

No rationale is given for having the library (r6rs enum) in the
report. Unless there is a compelling rationale, it is suggested that
the library be dropped.

Description

In the absence of a rationale, it is difficult to judge whether this
library is really essential. In contrast to most of the other
libraries included in the report,

I do not think enumerations were part of the r6rs mandate.

there does not seem to be a general feeling in the community that
enumerations are essential and should be standardized. it is unclear
what sets enumerations apart from a whole plethora of excluded
possible libraries that may have been as useful or more useful. there
is no widespread prior usage experience of enumerations. it seems to
be an ad hoc encapsulation of accidental functionality used in the
implementation of other libraries.

I do not personally know a sufficiently strong reason to include this
library in the report. I do not deny that enumerations may be useful,
but since the report is already regarded by many as too large, perhaps
this library might be profitably excised. Suggestion

Perhaps drop this library. Alternatively, it may be helpful to provide
a compelling rationale for including it.

RESPONSE:

The following rationale is the basis for the decision to include
enumerations:

Many procedures in many libraries accept arguments from a finite set,
or subsets of a finite sets to describe a certain mode of operation,
or several flags to describe a mode of operation.  Examples in the
R6RS include the endianness for bytes-object operations, and file and
buffering modes in the I/O library.  As the mandate of the R6RS is to
foster portable and readable code, it makes sense to offer a default
policy for dealing with such values.  (Much as records do for compound
values, or multiple values for procedures computing several values.)
Moreover, as noted in an earlier formal comment, representations of
sets from a finite set of options should offer the standard set
operations, as they tend to occur in practice.  (One such set
operation is the complement, which makes lists of symbols a less than
suitable representation, by the way.)

Different Scheme implementations have taken different approaches to
this problem in the past, which suggests that a default policy does
not merely encode what any sensible programmer would do anyway.  Given
how often possible uses occur, it makes perfect sense to standardize
this particular aspect of interface construction.
