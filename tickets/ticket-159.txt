Formal comment #159 (defect)

(r6rs base) must also export _ and ... at level 1
Reported by: 	Andre van Tonder
Version:	5.92

Pages : 25
Summary:

It is stated on p.25 that (r6rs base) exports syntax-rules and
identifier-syntax at level 1. This is insufficient for writing most
useful macros unless the identifiers ... and _ are also exported for
level 1.

Proposed correction:

State that the identifiers ... and _ are exported at level 1 by (r6rs
base).


RESPONSE:

Agreed.  The suggested change will be made in the next draft.
