Invoking toplevel undefined
Reported by: 	Andre van Tonder
Version:	5.92

Summary:

An orphan reference to the terminology "invoke" exists in the toplevel
program semantics.  Description:

Section 7.2 starts with the following:

"A top-level program is executed by treating the program similarly to
a library, and invoking it."

However, the description of what it means to "invoke" a library, which
was contained in the previous version, has been dropped in this
version.
