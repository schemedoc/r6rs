Formal comment #179 (simplification)

Compound conditions considered bogus

Summary: Compound conditions solve the wrong problem

In the current design, there are two kinds of conditions: simple
conditions, which have a type (with a single inheritance tree) and a
property list, and compound conditions, which are an ordered list of
simple conditions. Compound conditions have no types as such, but act
as if they belonged to all the types of the simple conditions from
which they are composed. Property values can be reliably retrieved
from a compound condition iff it has no more than one component
condition of each type. Conditions are immutable.

This poor man's multiple inheritance makes it messy and awkward to add
a new type to an existing condition. If the existing condition is
simple, one must create a compound condition containing the new and
the existing condition; but if it is compound, one must unwrap the
compound condition, create a new condiion, and rewrap all the simple
conditions into a new compound condition. In either case, properties
will not be lost but may be shadowed.

I sketched a couple of more general solutions involving full-bore
multiple inheritance (a la C++) and multiple prototypes (a la Self),
but that dragged in all the well-known consequences of those
solutions, even though there are only (public) data members/fields and
not methods. Therefore, I decided to suggest something simpler:

All conditions are simple and condition types provide single
inheritance only. However, any condition can contain another condition
wrapped in it. In this design, all conditions have a single type (plus
the ancestral types, of course). However, conditions can carry
additional information in the form of other conditions, and it's easy
to add information to a condition by wrapping it.

Specifics:

The make-condition-type, condition-type?, make-condition, and
condition? procedures and the define-condition-type syntax are
unchanged. The condition-has-type? procedure applies only to the
condition itself, not to its wrapped condition.

(wrap-condition condition type alist) creates a new condition of the
specified type and with the specified property list, wrapping the
specified condition.

(unwrap-condition condition) returns the condition wrapped in the
specified condition, or #f if there is none.

(unwrap-all-conditions condition) returns a list of conditions: the
first is the specified condition, the second is the condition wrapped
in it, the third is the condition wrapped in that, etc.

I don't know whether the syntax "condition" is still useful under this
design. I suspect not.
