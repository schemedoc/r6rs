Hashtable issues

Summary: 

Minor issues in hashtable API.

Description: 

- In the rationale of hash-table-copy with immutable, it is stated that 

"Also, a library may choose to export a hash table which cannot be
changed by clients."

This may not be the best rationale, because it suggests that this is
useful for access control that makes the table read-only to the
client. However, the exporting "server" library won't be able to
change the hash table copy either. So "changed by clients" is
misleading.

Also, this has nothing to do with libraries, since any local scope can
"export" a read-only hashtable by returning an immutable copy in this
way.

- How often are "hash-table-keys" and "hash-table-values" really used, and 

even when they are, are they really a good abstraction?

Since they are trivially expressible in terms of -fold, as stated in
the document, please consider dropping these.
