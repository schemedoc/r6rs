Formal comment #183 (defect)

The standard-*-port procedures should return a fresh binary port
Reported by: 	John Cowan
Version:	5.92

Currently, the procedures standard-input-port, standard-output-port,
and standard-error-port are very vague. One does not know if one will
get a binary or a textual port, though a textual port is encouraged;
one does not know if it is safe to close the port or not.

I suggest that the definition be firmed up: the port returned must be
fresh and binary. In this way it may be safely closed and safely
converted to a textual port without risking the usability of any
existing port.

The existing position is radically unsafe: if one closes or
textualizes the port, one may implicitly close a port in use elsewhere
in the program. If one gets a textual port and the transcoding is
inappropriate to the application, there is nothing to be done, as
there is (deliberately) no way to recover the underlying binary port.


RESPONSE:

The specification of these three procedures will be firmed up
as suggested in the second paragraph of the formal comment.

In addition, a current-error-port procedure will be added to
(r6rs i/o simple).  The current-input-port, current-output-port,
and current-error-port procedures of (r6rs i/o simple) will be
exported by (r6rs i/o ports) as well.  These three procedures
do not return fresh ports on every call, although the first two
can be redirected using the with-input-from-file or
with-output-to-file procedures.
