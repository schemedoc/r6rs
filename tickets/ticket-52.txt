In order to catch uses of inexact numbers where exact numbers are
required, Scheme explicitly distinguishes exact from inexact numbers.

From what I have seen, "Using an inexact number where an exact number
is required" is less common of a programming error than producing a
non-real number where a real number is required. This happens when
SQRT, LOG, or EXPT is taken of noisy data without first checking the
range of the argument. If a sample is negative, then a complex number
will be the result of the operation. Calling inexact-only procedures
does not detect this common error.

"Using an inexact number where an exact number is required" also
seems less common than producing a non-integer where an integer
is required. This occurs when / is used instead of QUOTIENT; or
from program logic errors regarding the divisibility of integer
variables. Calling exact-only procedures does not detect this
common error because non-integer exact rationals are exact. 

SRFI-94 introduces 14 real-only and 3 integer-only variants of R5RS
procedures to facilitate numerical type checking and declaration. This
is a significant reduction compared to the scores of procedures
described by sections 16.5 "Exact Arithmetic" and 16.6 "Inexact
Arithmetic".

SRFI-94 being a much smaller burden on implementations, and its not
containing useless functions for orthogonality's sake, I propose that
it be incorporated into section 9.10.2. "Numerical operations"; and
that sections 16.5 "Exact Arithmetic" and 16.6 "Inexact Arithmetic" be
removed.

DRAFT RESPONSE

Ticket #52 asserts that using an inexact number where an exact
number is required is a less common error than producing non-real
numbers where real numbers are required, or non-integers where
integers are required.  All of these errors are known to happen,
but we do not know of any empirical data that would tell us which
kinds of errors are more frequent.

Ticket #52 also observes that SRFI 94 is simpler than the
(r6rs arithmetic exact) and (r6rs arithmetic inexact) libraries
that are described in sections 16.5 and 16.6 of the draft R6RS.
SRFI 94 addresses a different problem, of course.

Ticket #52 proposes that SRFI 94 replace the (r6rs arithmetic exact)
and (r6rs arithmetic inexact) libraries that are described in
sections 16.5 and 16.6 of the draft R6RS.

It is not clear why Ticket #52 proposes to replace those two
libraries instead of adding SRFI 94 to them.  Since exactness
is orthogonal to type, the problem addressed by SRFI 94 is
orthogonal to the problems addressed by the (r6rs arithmetic
exact) and (r6rs arithmetic inexact) libraries.

The arguments for all three libraries are similar, and we have
no evidence that would tell us which of the problems addressed
by the three libraries are more common or important.  There
seem to two sensible courses of action:

1.  Add SRFI 94 to the R6RS, to join the libraries described in
sections 16.5 and 16.6 of the draft R6RS.

2.  Remove the libraries described in sections 16.5 and 16.6 of
the draft R6RS, and make each of them into a SRFI like SRFI 94.

Will recommends the second course of action (with caveats
listed in response to Ticket #40).  None of the three
libraries have been tested in the field.  All three
libraries could be described by a SRFI and provided by
portable reference implementations that, in compiled
systems, would be just as efficient as if the libraries
were part of the R6RS.
