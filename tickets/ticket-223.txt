allow port position to be "magic cookie"
Reported by: 	Per Bothner
Version: 	5.92

port-position and set-port-position! are specified to get/set the
port's current position as a byte offset. But there are many kinds of
ports which do have a position, and on which the position can be
changed, but not using a byte offset. This includes most text ports
(except those implemented using simple stateless transcoders). In some
cases a character offset may make more sense.

Suggestion: For non-binary ports allow the use of any arbitrary
integral "magic cookie" as the position. One could also allow an
arbitrary value (such as a record), though that reduces the
"typeability" of these procedures. However, that would allow a
straight-forward wrapping of C's fgetpos/fsetpos.
