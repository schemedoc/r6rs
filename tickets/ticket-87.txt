The draft R6RS often specifies things that do not need to be
specified, even as it neglects to specify related things that do need
to be specified.

For example, the draft R6RS often does a better job of specifying
which programs are incorrect (because they raise an exception) than of
specifying which programs are correct, or of how correct programs will
behave.

The R6RS ought to distinguish the responsibilities of programmers
(clients) from the responsibilities of those who implement the
language (implementors). It ought to describe those responsibilities
clearly, without pretending one set of responsibilities can be
inferred from the other. In particular, the R6RS ought not to pretend
everything that implementations are not required to detect is legal,
nor to pretend implementations must detect all illegal programs.

This is a pervasive problem with the draft R6RS. The problem appears
to be rooted within a tacit philosophy or ideology whose unintended
effects are to increase the complexity of the draft R6RS and to
interfere with the pragmatic goal of writing portable programs. This
comment describes several specific examples of the problem, but
systematic repair will require reconsideration and editing of the
entire report.

* * 

The reports on Scheme amount to informal axiomatic specifications of
the language. Programmers can rely on any behavior that is implied by
the axioms, and cannot rely on any behavior that is not implied by the
axioms. Implementations of Scheme must satisfy the axioms, but may
exhibit arbitrary behavior for situations not covered by the axioms.

In model-theoretic words, an implementation is a model of the
axiomatic specification (not the other way around). The Scheme reports
are like the axioms of group theory or point set topology---and unlike
the axioms of Euclidean plane geometry or the second order axioms of
Peano arithmetic---in that they are intended to describe many models
(implementations), not just one.

Portable programs must rely only on behaviors that are guaranteed by
the axioms. One of the main reasons it has been so difficult to write
portable programs in Scheme is that the axiomatic specifications
expressed by previous reports were too weak. It is appropriate for the
R6RS to strengthen those specifications.

The R6RS does not need to strengthen its specification so much that it
allows only one model, or a single behavior, or a single
implementation, or recursively enumerable behaviors. Unnecessary
over-specification, such as specifying the unspecified value, does not
contribute to portability; it is more likely to detract from
portability, by wasting time on things that don't
matter. Over-specification also increases the complexity of the
report, which makes it harder for reviewers of the draft to spot
problems with it, and makes misinterpretation of the specification by
programmers and implementors alike more likely.

Over-specification is counter-productive. 

Where previous reports have erred by under-specifying, the draft R6RS
frequently errs by over-specifying, while continuing to under-specify
some of the more important things. For example, the draft R6RS often
provides a detailed specification of circumstances under which
implementations are required to raise some exception, while failing to
describe the circumstances under which implementations are forbidden
to raise the exception. When writing a portable program, it is more
important to know what will work (i.e. will not raise an exception)
than to know what won't.

In short, the draft R6RS has its priorities backwards. 

* * 

Here are six specific examples of the general problem: 

immutable objects (section 4.7) 
library phasing (section 6.2) 
script syntax (section 7.1.1) 
the unspecified value (section 9.8) 
list utilities (section 12) 
plausible lists (section 23.3) 

* * 

Immutable objects (section 4.7).

This problem is inherited from the R5RS. The problem is that the
"immutable objects", as defined in section 4.7, are explicitly
implementation-dependent. (What's more, the antecedent of the phrase
"such systems" is so unclear that neither programmers nor implementors
can tell for sure which implementations even have immutable objects.) 
This makes it harder for programmers to figure out what they must do
to write portable programs.

Fixing the problem is easy. The R6RS should give an
implementation-independent definition of immutable objects, as the
objects that result from evaluation of a literal constant together
with the strings returned by symbol->string (and perhaps a few other
objects). The R6RS should say that correct programs do not try to
mutate immutable objects, and that implementations should (not "must")
raise an exception when mutation of an immutable object is attempted.

That is how the matter was handled in the R4RS. The changes made in
the R5RS may have been motivated by some ideological discomfort
surrounding the fact that most existing implementations cannot
distinguish the immutable objects from the mutable ones, and therefore
cannot reliably raise the exception they should raise. That kind of
embarrassment should not stand in the way of specifying the semantics
of immutable objects.

* * 

Library phasing (section 6.2). 

The last paragraph of section 6.2 talks about what implementations are
allowed to do, and states that "a portable library's meaning must not
depend on whether the invocations are distinguished or preserved
across phases or library expansions."

That paragraph is an example of what I am asking the R6RS to do more
consistently: It explains the programmer's responsibility. It also
says that implementations have no obligation to implement many details
of the phasing semantics that had been described by the previous 22
paragraphs of section 6.2.

In other words, section 6.2 contains a complex specification that
implementations are not required to implement, and on which programs
cannot rely.

Hence programmers must establish the correctness of portable libraries
under the assumption that the phasing semantics is implemented, and
also under the assumption that a single set of bindings is shared by
all phases.

It seems to me that the complex phasing semantics, on which libraries
cannot rely but with which they must nonetheless be prepared to cope,
hinders the development of portable libraries more than it helps.

One possible solution is for the R6RS to sketch only a vague semantics
for phase levels, perhaps along the lines of the semantics given for
declarations in section 9.22, instead of specifying so many details
that implementations are explicitly allowed to ignore.

The main thing programmers need to know about phase levels is that
they matter only for procedural macros and for libraries used by
procedural macros. With the draft R6RS, the easiest way to cope with
the phasing problems in portable code is to avoid all use of the (r6rs
syntax-case) library. If that were to remain true in the R6RS, then
the R6RS ought to say so.
* * 

Script syntax (section 7.1.1). 

The first line of a script is required to be: 

#! /usr/bin/env scheme-script<linefeed> 

with no space allowed before the <linefeed>. 

On the other hand, implementations are required to ignore the first
line, even if it is not the above.

The draft R6RS gives a rationale for requiring implementations to
ignore the first line, and almost states a rationale for requiring all
Scheme programs to contain the line that will be ignored: On Unix, the
ignored line will make the program look like a shell script.

Of course, an incorrect Scheme program might have something else, such
as meaningless garbage, on its first line. According to the draft
R6RS, such incorrect programs must nevertheless behave like programs
that have the prescribed first line---even on Unix.

That implies that executing a Scheme program as a Unix shell script is
not allowed by the draft R6RS, except as part of some larger process
that ensures Unix will (in effect) ignore the first line. Since that
larger process might just as well insert the first line, the
specification of that line's syntax within the draft R6RS does not
serve any apparent purpose.

If implementations must ignore the first line of a Scheme script, then
the Unix-specific syntax of that first line should either be dropped
or reduced to a mere recommendation, and the formal syntax of scripts
should allow anything on the first line.

As things stand, the most important role of the formal syntax is to
define what is meant by "the first line." Since the draft R6RS
requires implementations to accept first lines other than the one
generated by the grammar, however, the formal syntax given in the
draft R6RS serves no real purpose, and the definition of that first
line becomes an interesting, albeit silly, question. For example, does
the draft R6RS allow a first line that contains multiple line
separators? That contains multiple returns? That contains multiple
linefeeds? * *

The unspecified value (section 9.8).

"The unspecified value is not a datum value, and thus has no external
representation."

Since the draft R6RS does not specify or even constrain the output
produced when a value that has no external representation is passed to
procedures such as write, implementations are free to print the
unspecified value however they like. An R6RS-conformant implementation
might print the unspecified value as (), or as #f, or as 42.

Specifying an unspecified value that may print the same as the empty
list is no less confusing than allowing procedures to return the empty
list when no result is specified.

I do not believe that specifying the unspecified value will improve
portability in any meaningful way. If the R6RS must specify the
unspecified value, however, then the R6RS should specify an external
representation for the unspecified value, so programmers will
recognize it when they see it.

* * 

List utilities (section 12). 

The specifications of find, forall, exists, filter, partition,
fold-left, fold-right, remp, memp, assp all say that the proc argument
must take a certain number of arguments, but only when the list
arguments are nonempty.

It would be simpler just to specify the number of arguments that the
proc argument must take, independently of the length of the list
arguments. No purpose is served by widening the range of proc
arguments for just one boundary case, but some costs of that widening
are clear. One cost is the increased complexity of
specification. Another is that compilers would be forbidden to warn
about things like

(find vector-set! x) 

when the compilers can't prove that x won't be the empty list.

Implementations should not be required to raise an exception when
things like (find vector-set! '()) are executed, but they should be
allowed to raise an exception.

Similarly, the specifications of find, forall, exists, memp, member,
memv, memq, assq, assoc, assv, and assq were made more complex by
forbidding these procedures to traverse a list past the point at which
their result could be known.

It would be simpler just to require their arguments to be lists (or
association lists). These procedures should all be allowed to raise an
exception if any of their list arguments are not a list, even if their
"natural" implementations would not be likely to detect that
violation. These procedures should not be required to detect that
violation, however, except perhaps when they have to traverse the
entire list anyway; even then, simplicity argues against requiring the
exception, as does the SRFI 1 semantics of some similar procedures.

As with immutable objects, I suspect the unnecessary complexity of
specification in section 12 grew out of ideological discomfort with
the idea that systems might enjoy some leeway with respect to when and
whether they raise exceptions. Ideological discomfort should not be
allowed to complicate the semantics of Scheme.

* * 

Plausible lists (section 23.3). 

The unnecessary complexity of specification in section 12 really comes
home to roost when pairs are mutable, as in section 23.3. Almost all
of the complexity in that section could be avoided by stipulating that
programmers are responsible for making sure that all list arguments
are lists, and no list argument may be mutated during the call
while limiting implementations' responsibilities: implementations
should raise an exception if any list argument is not a list, but
implementations are not required to raise those exceptions

Note that reliable detection of non-lists is impossible in systems
with mutable pairs and concurrent execution, and is inefficient even
with sequential execution of higher order procedures.

(Most of the higher-order procedures could copy their list arguments
on entry, which isn't too bad, but that wouldn't work for memp, whose
result must share structure with its list argument. In any case, the
copying solution doesn't always work when a concurrent process
lengthens the list while it is being copied, and the inefficiency of
copying matters even for sequential execution.)

Note also that the complex specifications of the draft R6RS do not
serve their apparent purpose of requiring detection of non-list
arguments, since a plausible list may not be a list. In practice,
traditional implementations of the specification sketched above would
detect about as many bugs as the superficially stricter and far more
complex semantics described by the draft R6RS.

* * 

Although each of the examples presented above could be the subject of
a more specific formal comment, their purpose in this formal comment
is to illustrate a general tendency of the draft R6RS toward
unnecessary over-specification, which often masks related
under-specification. I believe it is more important to recognize and
to correct the general tendency than to fix these specific examples of
it.

RESPONSE:

We are in general agreement with the sentiment of the formal comment
and will work toward revising the report draft accordingly.
