Subject: [Formal] Implementation-specific declarations
Message-ID: <20070605191507.GG28763@mercury.ccil.org>

Submitter: John Cowan
Email address: cowan at ccil.org
Issue type: Defect
Priority: Trivial
Component:  Informal semantics
Report version: 5.93
Summary: Implementation-specific declarations" is a stray expression

Report section 4.5 speaks of "implementation-specific declarations",
even though declarations have been gone since 5.91.  Some other
language should be chosen, such as "may provide non-conformant
implementation modes that do not guarantee safety."
