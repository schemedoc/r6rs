Clean-up in the additional arithmetic libraries
Reported by:	Alan Watson

Component:	arithmetic
Version:	5.91

Consistency and simplicity of naming is important, especially when
dealing with libratries that introduce variants on a common operation.

I propose the following renamings and additions to the arithmetic
libraries defined in section 16. These have the global advantage of
using exactly the same names for both generic and type-specific
procedures representing similar mathematical operations.

How then would one distinguish between different procedures with the
same name? One would use the renaming or prefixing procedures allowed by
the library system. For example, one would import the fixnum procedures
with a prefix of "fixnum:". This would give completely consistent names;
currently some of the current names are prefixed by "fixnum" and others
by "fixnum-", and some have an appended "?".

16.3.1
======

Library (r6rs arithmetic fixnum) is renamed as (r6rs arithmetic fixnum
quotient-ring) or (r6rs arithmetic fixnum modular).

Current                         New

fixnum?                         number?
NONE                            complex?
NONE                            real?
NONE                            rational?
NONE                            integer?

NONE                            real-valued?
NONE                            rational-valued?
NONE                            integer-values?

   All of these routines are synonums for the current "fixnum?".

   Rationale: The generic routines use these procedures to discern types.
   The fixnum specific routines should use the the same names. In this
   context, "number?" means "Does the fixnum library treat this as a
   number?".

NONE                            exact?
NONE                            inexact?

   Comment: Equivalent to the generic exact? and inexact?, but with the
   arguments restricted for fixnums.

NONE                            ->inexact
NONE                            ->exact

   Comment: Fixnum to general inexact and general number to fixnum,
   signalling if "no reasonable close equivalent".

fixnum-div+mon                  div-and-mod

   Comment: "+" means something quite specific in arithmetic. The routine
   "div+mod" should properly return the sum of the div and mod. With
   "div-and-mod", this confusion does not arise.

fixnum-div                      div

fixnum-mod0                     mod0

NONE                            gcd
NONE                            lcm

fixnum+/carry                   +-with-carry
fixnum-/carry                   /-with-carry
fixnum*/carry                   *-with-carry

   Comment: The use of "/" to mean "with" is specific to only certain
   dialects of English. It is not well know, for example, in British
   English. Furthermore, "/" already has a specific meaning in
   arithmetic; the procedure "+/carry" should return the sum divided by
   the carry.

fixnum-not                      bitwise-not
fixnum-and                      bitwise-and
fixnum-ior                      bitwise-or
fixnum-xor                      bitwise-exclusive-or

   Comment: These perform bitwise operations, not logical operations, and
   should be marked as such. For example, using "bitwise-not" makes it
   clear that the procedure corresponds to C's "~" operations not C's "!"
   operations.

   I suggest "or" instead of "ior" because "or" is already used in the
   base library to mean inclusive or (albeit a logical inclusive or).

   I suggest "exclusive-or" instead of "xor" because Scheme has
   historically preferred to avoid abreviations. However, "xor" would not
   be wrong.

fixnum-if                       bitwise-if

fixnum-bit-count                bit-count

fixnum-bit-field                bit-field
fixnum-copy-bit-field           copy-bit-field

NONE                            set-bit!

   Comment: This should be the same as:

      (fixnum-copy-bit fx1 fx2 (fixnum-logical-shift-left 1 fx2))

fixnum-arithmetic-shift         arithmetic-shift
fixnum-arithmetic-shift-left    arithmetic-shift-left

fixnum-logical-shift-left       bitwise-shift-left
fixnum-logical-shift-right      bitwise-shift-right

   Comment: "logical" in the context of Scheme seems to me to refer more
   to booleans. I would suggest "bitwise-shift" here or, failing that,
   just plain "shift".

   Comment: Why is there no three-argument logical shift, to match the
   three-argument arithmetic shift?

fixnum-rotate-bit-field         rotate-bit-field
fixnum-reverse-bit-field        reverse-bit-field

NONE                            number->string
NONE                            string->number

16.3.2
======

Library "(r6rs arithmetic fx)" is renamed "(r6rs arithmetic fixnum
signalling)".

Similar changes are made in the procedures.

In addition, I see no reason for omitting procedures simply because they
depend on the precision w, so I would add the carry procedures and the
logical shift procedures. The results are perfectly well defined,
although obviously they depend on w.

16.5 Exact arithmetic
=====================

By now, the pattern of my suggested renamings should be clear.

This library also needs:

   real?
   real-valued?
   rational-valued?
   integer-valued?
   exact?
   inexact?
   ->inexact
   ->exact
   real->flonum
   real->single
   real->double
   infinite?
   finite?
   nan?
   rationalize
   string->number
   number->string

along with appropriate additions corresponding to the added fixnum 
procedures.

16.6 Inexact arithmetic
=======================

Again, renamings to remove prefixes and spurious ? suffixes, along with:

   real-valued?
   rational-valued?
   integer-valued?
   exact?
   inexact?
   ->exact
   ->inexact
   real->flonum
   real->single
   real->double
   rationalize
   acos
   string->number
   number->string

RESPONSE:

Formal comment #120 proposes renaming of the (r6rs arithmetic fixnum),
and (r6rs arithmetic fx) libraries.

More importantly, Formal comment #120 proposes to rename most procedures
that are exported by all five of the libraries described in sections
16.3, 16.4, 16.5, and 16.6 of the draft R6RS.  The renaming would
"have the global advantage of using exactly the same names for
both generic and type-specific procedures" that have related
(but generally not identical) semantics.  The basic idea of the
renaming is to strip off the prefix that identifies the library
from which the procedure is imported and (in most cases) the
types of its arguments.  To prevent illegal name clashes, programs
that use one of those libraries together with (r6rs base) would
have to rename the imported procedures, typically by prefixing
them with a programmer-specified prefix.

The net effect would be to let the renaming prefix be chosen by
individual programmers, which would make it harder for Scheme
programmers to read each other's code.

Several of the proposed renamings are controversial.  For
example, a program that imports (r6rs arithmetic fixnum) and
uses "fixnum:" as a prefix would import all of the following
names for exactly the same procedure:

    fixnum:number?
    fixnum:complex?
    fixnum:real?
    fixnum:rational?
    fixnum:integer?
    fixnum:real-valued?
    fixnum:rational-valued?
    fixnum:integer-values?

It would also import fixnum:exact?, which is the generic exact?
procedure restricted to fixnum arguments; that procedure would
return #t whenever it does not raise an exception.  Similarly
fixnum:inexact? would raise #f whenever it does not raise an
exception.

Most of the changes proposed by Formal comment #120 would be more
confusing than helpful, and should not be adopted for the R6RS.

Some of the renamings suggested by Formal comment #120 are plausible.
The following suggestions were considered by the editors
(without dropping the prefix):

    draft R6RS                      possible renaming

    fixnum-div+mod                  fixnum-div-and-mod
    fixnum-div0+mod0                fixnum-div0-and-mod0
    fixnum+/carry                   fixnum+with-carry
    fixnum-/carry                   fixnum-with-carry
    fixnum*/carry                   fixnum*with-carry
    fixnum-ior                      fixnum-or
    fixnum-xor                      fixnum-exclusive-or

The editors decided to adopt the first two renamings (with
implications for similarly named procedures); the others were
not.  (Rationale for not adopting the other renamings:  When
fixnum-with-carry is seen by itself, the minus sign is more
likely to be read as a hyphen.  When seen by itself, fixnum-or
is not as clear as fixnum-ior.  The corresponding fxior and
fxxor were judged a nicer pair than fxor and fxexclusive-or.)

The rationale for including the X-arithmetic-shift procedures
but not any X-logical-shift procedures is that the arithmetic
shifts have simple definitions in terms of the generic floor,
*, and expt procedures, but the semantics of a logical shift
involves an essential discontinuity based on the sign of the
second argument.

As suggested by formal comments #120 and #121, an flacos procedure
should be added to the (r6rs arithmetic flonum) library.
