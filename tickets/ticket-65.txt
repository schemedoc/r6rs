Formal comment #65 (defect)

eq?/eqv? misbehave around NaNs
Reported by:	John Cowan
Priority:	minor
Milestone:	r6rs
Component: Base library 

Summary

The fact that (= +nan.0 +nan.0) is #f has unexpected knock-on effects
on eq? and eqv?. Description

In particular, (lambda (x) (eqv? x x) +nan.0) and its equivalent
(lambda (x) (eq? x x) +nan.0) are compelled to return #f by the
definitions of eqv? and eq?. This is extremely counterintuitive, and
makes the suggestion that eq? compare pointers unusable: the pointers
must be checked to see if they happen to point to flonums which happen
to be NaNs?.

I have two alternative proposals: 

1) Allow eqv? and eq? to return either #t or #f if both arguments are
   NaNs?. 2) Require eqv? to return #t if both arguments are NaNs?.

eq? would be permitted to return either #t or #f, as with all numbers.

RESPONSE:

That specification of `eqv?'  says that `eqv?' returns #t "if" any of
several things are true, and returns #f "if" any of several other
things are true.  There is no "only if" or "if and only if".  The
behavior of eqv? on NaNs is not specified by section 9.6.  A
clarifying example will be added to that effect.

The basic reason why the behavior of `eqv?' is not specified on NaNs
is that the IEEE-754 standard does not say much about how the bits of
a NaN are to be interpreted, and explicitly allows implementations of
that standard to use most of a NaN's bits to encode
implementation-dependent semantics.  The implementors of a Scheme
system should therefore decide how `eqv?' should interpret those bits.
