Formal comment #99 (defect)

"Byte-vector" would be a better name than "bytes" for a data type

Version:	5.91

In <11. Bytes objects>, I suggest using the term "byte-vector" instead
of "bytes." A plural name for the type will lead to confusion and is
inconsistent with the names used for all other Scheme types. Even if
"byte-vector" isn't chosen, please consider a singular name. I'd much
rather say "two byte-vectors" instead of "two byteses" or "two objects
of type bytes" or the ambiguous "two bytes."

RESPONSE:

A future revision of the draft will use a different (non-plural,
non-hyphenated) name.
