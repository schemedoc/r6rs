Formal comment #137 (minor)

Non-ASCII characters should not be treated all alike

The lexical syntax should not allow Nd, Mc, or Me characters to be
initial in identifiers. Allowing a sequence of Nd characters to be
identifiers means that digit-strings in non-ASCII digits are
identifiers. I don't insist that all digit-strings be numerals, but
they certainly should not be identifiers.

Likewise, Unicode semantics attaches a Mc or Me character to its
predecessor, which would not be part of the identifier. That's
undesirable.
