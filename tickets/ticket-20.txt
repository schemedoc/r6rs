"regular expression" confusing in 9.5.7
Reported by:	John Cowan
Priority:	minor
Component:	baselibrary
Version:	5.91

In the second bullet of 9.5.7 (p. 34), the phrase "regular expression"
is confusing because it is a term of art which is not being used in
its technical meaning. I suggest "ordinary expression".

RESPONSE:

This will be fixed in the next draft of the report.
