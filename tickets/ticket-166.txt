Formal comment #166 (enhancement)

Make unspecified return values of eq? / eqv? unspecified
Reported by: 	Mike Sperber
Version:	5.92

Summary

The specification of eq? and eqv? should allow portability-checking
implementations.  Description

In the current draft, the return value of eq?' and eqv?' isn't
specified for all combinations of arguments. Yet, the return value is
constrained to be #t or #f.

This makes it easy to write unportable programs, for example by using
`eq?' to compare characters under the assumption that it's faster than
`char=?', or by using it to a number to assumed to be a fixnum with an
immediate representation that `eq?' handles. As an implementation must
return #t or #f even when applied to arguments where the return is
unspecified, the draft does not permit an implementation that would
detect (some) unspecified cases and notify the programmer and/or user
in that case.

Suggestion

Allow implementations to return other values than #t or #f for the
unspecified cases, and also allow them to abort the program or raise
an exception for those cases.

RESPONSE:

Despite being left open to interpretation, eqv? is not entirely
unspecified for any pair of objects, since it returns true if the two
objects "should normally be regarded as the same object".  Thus it may be
useful even in cases where different implementations may return different
boolean values, e.g., for applications such as memoization.  Allowing eqv? 
to abort or raise an exception would require additional checks or setting
of exception handlers in such applications.  Allowing return of an
unspecified value does not seem useful since eqv? is typically used
only for its truth value and even unspecified values have truth values. 
The situation is similar for eq?.  Therefore, the formal comment is
rejected.
