Formal comment #166 (enhancement)

Make unspecified return values of eq? / eqv? unspecified
Reported by: 	Mike Sperber
Version:	5.92

Summary

The specification of eq? and eqv? should allow portability-checking
implementations.  Description

In the current draft, the return value of eq?' and eqv?' isn't
specified for all combinations of arguments. Yet, the return value is
constrained to be #t or #f.

This makes it easy to write unportable programs, for example by using
`eq?' to compare characters under the assumption that it's faster than
`char=?', or by using it to a number to assumed to be a fixnum with an
immediate representation that `eq?' handles. As an implementation must
return #t or #f even when applied to arguments where the return is
unspecified, the draft does not permit an implementation that would
detect (some) unspecified cases and notify the programmer and/or user
in that case.

Suggestion

Allow implementations to return other values than #t or #f for the
unspecified cases, and also allow them to abort the program or raise
an exception for those cases.
