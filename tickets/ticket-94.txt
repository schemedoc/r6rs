Formal comment #94 (enhancement)

Illegal null cases in import syntax
Reported by:	Andre van Tonder

Component:	libraries
Version:	5.91

Summary: 

In conflict with the rest of the report, certain null cases that make
sense are prohibited in the import syntax. It is requested that these
null cases be legalized.

Description: 

In the current description of

<version> = <empty> | (<subversion1> <subversion2> ...) 

presumably the intent is that <empty> be thought of as shorthand for
the second line with zero subversions. The description of subversion
matching implicitly assumes this. However, it is currently not allowed
to write this out as in, for example,

(library (foo ()) ---). 

This is in conflict with the entire rest of the report, where empty
cases are always legal syntax where it makes sense.

For example, it is legal to write

(import) (export) (for foo) (rename foo) (fields) ; in record definitions ... 

Allowing the empty list here, and stating that <empty> in the above
grammar abbreviates (),

- reduces confusion as to the meaning of <empty> - reduces the number
  of special cases in parsing the grammar - is consistent with the
  rest of Scheme, where all empty cases

are normally allowed where it makes sense

- follows a regularity that can simplify automatic generation

and processing of code

The same goes for the specifications of AND and OR in the import
syntax on page 22. In fact, since normal AND and OR do take zero
arguments, the current description of AND and OR in the import syntax
introduces a gratuitous inconsistency.

Suggestion: 

Please change the syntax of AND, OR, <version> and <version reference>
to work also for the null cases as follows:

(and <subversion condition> ...) 
(or <subversion condition> ...) 
<version> = <empty> | (<subversion> ...) 
<version reference> = <empty> | (<subversion reference> ...)

RESPONSE:

The next draft of the report will incorporate the suggestion.
