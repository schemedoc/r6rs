Formal comment #33 (defect)

Typo in definition of the sign function
Reported by:	Stanislav Ievlev

Component:	miscellaneous
Version:	5.91

Function sign should be: 

(define (sign n)
  (cond 
     ((negative? n) -1)
     ((positive? n) 1)
     (else 0)))

Previous definition returns zero on negative numbers.

RESPONSE:

This will be fixed in the next draft of the report.
