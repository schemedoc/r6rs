Ticket #53 (defect)

letrec* vs. letrec
Status: closed (fixed)
Reported by:	John Cowan

In 9.5.6 (p. 32), the text reads "in a letrec* and in a letrec
expression", suggesting that something was to be supplied for letrec*
but was not. I suggest something like "all bindings are in effect, but
evaluations are performed sequentially" for letrec*.

RESPONSE:

This will be fixed in the next draft of the report.
