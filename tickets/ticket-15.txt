Formal comment #15 (defect)

"Unicode scalar value" is preferred to "scalar value"
Reported by:	John Cowan
Priority:	minor
Component:	lexicalsyntax
Version:	5.91

This affects at least 3.1 (p. 11) and probably other places as well. I
checked with Ken Whistler at the Unicode Consortium, and he confirmed
that although "scalar value" and "Unicode scalar value" are synonyms,
it is the latter which is the defined term (Unicode 4.0 definition
D28) and is used throughout the Unicode Standard.

RESPONSE:

This will be fixed in the next draft of the report.
