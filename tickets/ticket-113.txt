Ticket #113 (simplification)

fenders should be dropped from syntax-rules
Status: new	Reported by:	David Van Horn	Assigned to:	dyb
Priority:	major	Milestone:	r6rs
Component:	macros	Version:	5.91

Summary

The <fender> production should be removed from the language of
syntax-rules forms. Description

Allowing fenders in syntax-rules significantly complicates the
semantics of syntax-rules-based transformations, introducing phase
distinctions where there used to be none and allowing the use of
arbitrary Scheme code in what was once a simple rewritting
specification. The complications add essentially no practical benefit
without also using the (r6rs syntax-case) library. With the inclusion
of syntax-case in R6RS, when fenders are needed, they may be used and
a derived form syntax-rules/fenders can be defined using (r6rs
syntax-case), but this makes it explicit that the enhanced facilities
provided by syntax-case are being relied upon.

RESPONSE:

Agreed.
