Formal comment #182 (enhancement)

Port predicates (New predicates wanted for different subtypes of ports)
Reported by: 	John Cowan
Version:	5.92

Currently R5.92RS has input-port? and output-port? and binary-port? I
propose adding textual-port?, input/output-port?, file-port?,
string-port?, and bytevector-port? with the obvious semantics.

A textual-port? predicate would be technically redundant, as by the
letter of R5.92RS all non-binary ports are textual; however, a
particular implementation might add ports which were neither binary
nor (in the general sense) textual, with new input or output
operations.
