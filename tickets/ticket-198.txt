Formal comment #198 (enhancement)

Allow compilers to reject obvious violations
Reported by: 	will
Version: 	5.92

The current draft legitimizes many situations that, according to the
R5RS, are clear errors. The draft generally does this by requiring all
implementations to raise a &violation exception when the situation
arises. That allows portable programs to implement an arbitrarily
bizarre semantics for the violation via inappropriate exception
handlers.

Unless we expect programmers to abuse the exception system on a
routine basis, however, the cause of a &violation exception is far
more likely to be a mistake than a deliberate misuse of the exception
system.

Several extant Scheme compilers already perform static analyses that
can occasionally establish that some expression would inevitably raise
a &violation exception were the expression ever to be executed. The
R6RS library system will make it much easier for compilers to detect
such violations at compile time.

The current draft of the R6RS effectively forbids static rejection of
libraries and programs that contain such violations, because there is
always the remote possiblity that the violation might be a deliberate
ploy to invoke some exception handler that might be installed by some
other library.

That seems unfortunate, especially when compared to the draft's
absolute requirements that programs containing &lexical or &syntax
violations always be rejected prior to execution.

I recommend that language such as the following be added to the
report:

    Implementations may reject a library or program prior to execution
    if they can establish that (1) some definition or expression
    within the library or program would inevitably raise a &violation
    exception were it ever to be executed, and (2) the exception would
    be raised without calling any of the following procedures: error,
    assertion-violation, raise, raise-continuable.

I also recommend that an assert syntax be added to the above list and
to the R6RS, with syntax akin to

  (assert <expression>)

and implementation-dependent semantics akin to

    (if (not <expression>)
        (assertion-violation #f "Assertion failed"))

but with the expectation that many systems will provide better error
messages, localization, and optimization than would be obtained with
the above macro expansion.

RESPONSE:

A programmer might have legimitate reasons for including an expression
in a program, that is, when evaluated, a violation.  They include dead
illustratory or incomplete code.  A Scheme system should not reject
such program a priori, as the code that actually runs may be perfectly
legal.

The `assert' form will be added to the next draft of the report.
