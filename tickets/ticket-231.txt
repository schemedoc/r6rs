Allow inline hex escapes anywhere

Description

The current report allows inline hex escapes (\x...;) in symbol
literals and string literals and has a similar but different scheme
for hex escapes in character literals. This allows one to write a
program that uses non-ASCII symbols, string, and character literals
using only ASCII characters.

The current report allows non-ASCII characters to appear in symbol
literals, string literals, character literals, whitespace, and in
comments. (I think that is an exhaustive list.)

Many current Schemes have lexers written for ASCII (or Latin-1)
character sets. Conversion of these lexers to the new standard would
be easier if the report allowed inline hex escapes to appear anywhere
in Scheme code. One would simply add a pass before the lexer that
converts non-ASCII characters to inline hex escapes and converts
inline hex escapes representing ASCII characters to ASCII characters,
and would modify the lexer to handle inline hex escapes as
appropriate.

For this scheme to work, the report must be modified, because a lexer
so modified cannot distinguish a hex escape that was subsituted for a
non-ASCII character from one that was present originally.

An alternative approach that would achieve more or less the same
effect would be to allow inline hex escapes anywhere, but outside of
strings and symbols require that they represent only non-ASCII
characters. I do not favor this restriction.

This modification would also create a means to portably interchange
programs using only ASCII, although I'm not sure if this is especially
useful given UTF-8.
