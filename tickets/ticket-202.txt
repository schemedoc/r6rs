Formal comment #202 (defect)

Minor wording issues
Reported by: 	Andre van Tonder

Description

(1)

The first sentence of section 4.2, which reads:

        In a library body, an identifier may name a type of syntax, or
        it may name a location where a value can be stored.

should probably be either of the following equivalent options

        In a library body or toplevel program, ..... In a Scheme
        program, ....

(2)

In the second paragraph of section 4.2, the sentence

        A definition binds a variable in a top-level program or
        library body.

does not take into account syntax definitions or internal definitions,
which are mentioned in passing at the end of the next paragraph. It
seems a bit jumbled to me, but see the next point:

(3)

I am not comfortable with the distinction being made between toplevel
and local bindings. It seems like a needlesss complication that may
have been necessary in r5rs but has been made irrelevant in r6rs. R6RS
does not distinguish them otherwise. In particular, the r6rs semantics
for library-level definitions is described in terms of letrec*
identically to that of internal definitions, and such bindings are in
fact local to the library form, so it feels misleading to say they are
not local bindings. In addition, the semantics of definitions in
toplevel programs are explained in terms of libraries/letrec* also, so
I would say all definitions in R6RS are in fact local.

(4)

Related to (3), the third paragraph of 4.2 is indeed misleading in
stating that all local variable bindings can be explained in terms of
lambda. It is misleading because R6RS also explains "toplevel"
bindings in terms of lambda (via letrec*).

(5)

In the last paragraph of section 4.2, the following sentence does not
make sense to me:

        If there is no binding of the identifier whose region contains
        the use, then the use refers to the binding for the variable
        in the top level environment of the library body or a binding
        imported from another library.

The sentence contradicts itself by apparently ascribing a binding to
an identifier that has no binding. Since the semantics of bindings in
library bodies is identical to that in lambda bodies, a
library-toplevel binding in fact is a binding with a clear region, in
contrast to what the first line of the above sentence appears to say.

(6)

The second sentence of 4.2 reads:

        An identifier that names a type of syntax is called a
        syntactic keyword and is said to be bound to that syntax.

The teminology "syntax" here is unclear (and has a different meaning
in the syntax-case library - in fact it is pattern variables, not
keywords, that get bound to pieces of syntax). In paragraph 6.2, it is
stated much more clearly that "Scheme libraries can define and use new
derived expressions and definitions called syntactic abstractions or
macros. A syntactic abstraction is created by binding a keyword to a
macro transformer or, simply, transformer."

I would therefore suggest replacing the two occurrences of "syntax" in
the above by "syntactic abstraction" or "macro transformer".

(7)

In 1.6, first paragraph, the following sentence is pre-r6rs:

        An expression that has a syntactic keyword as its operator
        obeys special rules determined by the keyword.

since it omits to mention the two cases of identifier macros and
variable transformers' behaviour in set!.

(8)

In 1.3, the sentence that first introduces the concept of variables:

        Scheme allows identifiers to denote values. These identifiers
        are called variables. (More precisely, variables denote
        locations. This distinction is not important, however, for a
        large proportion of Scheme code.)

starts by stating an erroneous definition and then immediately
contradicts itself. Since this is a major point of confusion, it may
be better if the language report were at least consistent in its
description of this. A language report is a formal document and does
not not need to follow the common 
pedagogical device of breaking the bad news slowly via partial lies ;)

(9)

In section 4.1, second paragraph:

   ... some facilities that are typically implemented as "primitives" by a
   compiler or run-time libraries ...

I suspect this use of "libraries" does not refer to the concept of
"library" as defined by the report.  This is confusing.

(10)

Paragraph 1.4 is more complicated than it needs to be by
distinguishing toplevel and local bindings a la r5rs.

(11)

Chapter 7 introduction, second paragraph, contains a residual mention
of the word "script" that should probably be removed.

(12)

Paragraph 7.1 contains the sentence:

   The rules for <toplevel program> specify syntax at the form level.

I don't understand what this means.

(13)

Section 4.2: Variables, syntactic keywords and regions, does not
mention the concept of *pattern variables* bound by
syntax-rules/syntax-case patterns.  Since these belong to the same
namespace, may shadow or be shadowed by other kinds of bindings, and
have their own regions, the description of scoping in this section is
incomplete without a mention of them.

(14)

Section 6.1 (library form)
Section 7.1 (toplevel program syntax)
Section 9.4 (bodies and sequences)

These sections mention that internal BEGINs are spliced.  However,
they do not mention the that internal LET[REC]-SYNTAXes are also
spliced.

In fact, it is not clear to me whether the grammar for bodies really
refer to the result of expansion or not.  If it refers to the /result/
of expansion, then it is misleading to mention that BEGINs are
spliced, since there are no BEGINs after expansion.  If it does not
refer to the result of expansion, then it is okay to mention splicing
of BEGINs, but then LET[REC]-SYNTAX should also be mentioned.

(15)

In section 1.8:

   Procedure definitions are also derived forms.

is not correct, since only the first of the two procedure definitions
examples below this sentence is a derived form.  The second is not.

(16)

Is the terminology "form" defined somewhere?  I could not find it.


RESPONSE:

Thanks for your suggestions and questions, most of which will be taken (or
in the case of questions, taken into account) in the next draft of the
report.

In general, however, library bindings aren't fully described in terms of
letrec*, since letrec* does not establish the exported identifier
bindings.  We'll leave it up to the project editor to decide the extent to
which they can be treated the same as other bindings.
