Base library needs a name
Status: closed (fixed)	Reported by:	Andre van Tonder	Assigned to:	sperber

Summary

The base library has no name. Because of this, identifiers in the base
library cannot be imported for a single phase.

Description

Even though the (r6rs) library contains all the bindings of the base
library, the base library has no name. As a result, the composite
library (r6rs) is not expressible as a library form. Since (r6rs)
exports its bindings for both RUN and EXPAND, there is no way in the
current specification of importing identifiers such as CAR, CDR,
... for a single phase (e.g., just for RUN). Users therefore have less
control over the availability of base library bindings than they do
for other libraries.

Suggestion

Define a library (r6rs base) that exports its bindings for RUN only.

RESPONSE:

This was an editorial oversight.  The (r6rs base) library is indeed
mentioned in several places in the report.  A future draft will state
this at the beginning of the chapter on the base library.
