Base library needs a name
Reported by:	Andre van Tonder

Component:	baselibrary
Version:	5.91

Component : Base library, Composite library 

Pages : 28 and also 122 

Summary

The base library has no name. Because of this, identifiers in the base
library cannot be imported for a single phase.

Description

Even though the (r6rs) library contains all the bindings of the base
library, the base library has no name. As a result, the composite
library (r6rs) is not expressible as a library form. Since (r6rs)
exports its bindings for both RUN and EXPAND, there is no way in the
current specification of importing identifiers such as CAR, CDR,
... for a single phase (e.g., just for RUN). Users therefore have less
control over the availability of base library bindings than they do
for other libraries.

Suggestion

Define a library (r6rs base) that exports its bindings for RUN only.

RESPONSE:

This was an editorial oversight.  The (r6rs base) library is indeed
mentioned in several places in the report.  The next draft will state
this at the beginning of the chapter on the base library.
