     primitive i/o             Matthew
   - items not ready for review
     exceptions & conditions
     eval
     I/O
     hash tables
     syntax-case
     library system
     scripts
     r5rs compatibility library
     operational semantics

3. removing the distinct S-expression requirement for case (5 minutes)
    no objections

4. name of contract-defect procedure (5 minutes)
    contract-violated might be a better name
    contract-violation might be more parallel
    related to:
        error
        violation (could ditch in favor of contract-violation)
    contract-violation it is (no objections)
    ditch violation

5. semantics of library-body call/cc (5 minutes)
    exported bindings are immutable after the initializing assignment
        definitions of non-exported variables may be executed more
        than once
    continuation for the entire library's invocation should be unspecified
    disallow multiple definitions of a variable within the same library

6. script syntax (5 minutes)
   - yes/no vote:
     <script header><optional #!r6rs><import form><interleaved library body>
     <import form> -> (import <import-spec>*)
     <interleaved library body> -> library body with interleaved definitions
        and commands
    Yes: Kent, Matthew, Anton, Will, Mike
    No: 
   - separate <script header> vote between:
     <script header> -> #!/usr/bin/scheme-script <line terminator>
     <script header> -> #!/usr/bin/env scheme-script <line terminator>
    #!/usr/bin/scheme-script
    #!/usr/bin/env
        consensus for #!/usr/bin/env

7. library phasing (10 minutes)
    allow both monophase and multiphase interpretations

order of import and export clauses
    Mike would like for the export clause to come first
        no objections

8. I/O (20 minutes)
    read+write issue
        Kent's email proposal sounds plausible
        no objections
    transcoder issue
        Will will write up a proposal that moves
            transcoders to operations, don't specify when opening

core/library split
    number and size of libraries to be described by R6RS
    something like Java's wild card syntax?
    Kent proposed something like
        (except (r6rs base (all-from syntax-case)))
    congruence between R6RS document and R6RS libraries

9. adjourned about 10:03am
