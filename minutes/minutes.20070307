     ticket-*.txt and set trac status to one of:
       blocker (red) = "don't know" but should should be easy
       critical (yellow) = done, probably uncontroversial
       major (white) = suggested response/action, but needs discussion
       minor (cyan) = we have to discuss it, first
       trivial (blue) = I'm stumped for the moment
     (All)
   - record response votes (All)

        response to 145 has been drafted
   - need final resolution in responses for ticket numbers 150, 164
   - timing of next conference call

2. what should (sqrt -0.0) return? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 141 quotes IEEE-754R draft that squareRoot(-0) should be -0
   - therefore suggests (flsqrt -0.0) should be -0.0
   - what about (sqrt -0.0)?
        allow it to return 0.0+0.0i
        this does not need to be mentioned
            in the response to the formal comment

3. allow unstable vector-sort! with worst-case o(n^2) behavior? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 142
        approved unanimously

            abstain: Anton
        input/output-port?
            no: everyone

5. keep last-minute 5.92 change to string and bytevector output ports?
   add string-port?, bytevector-port? predicates? (10 minutes)

6. revisit unspecified value and mrvs semantics? (5-15 minutes)
   - see ticket 152 response
   - question for us to vote upon: should we reopen these issues?
   - if we vote "yes" we can spend some time discussing the issues;
     otherwise, ticket-152 response is "comment withdrawn by submitter".

        tabled for email discussion

   of unspecified values? (5 minutes)

   (5 minutes)
   - ticket 154

9. floor, ceiling, truncate, and round raise an exception or abort on
   infinity and NaN arguments? (5 minutes)
   - ticket 167
        neither the formal comment nor the draft response
            use the word "abort"; that word appears only
            in Will's recommendation to accept the comment's
            proposal; but since it came up...
            Will moved to ratify Mike's current position that
                implementations are allowed to bypass the
                exception system for violations
            yes: Will, Mike
            no: Kent, Matthew, Anton
            motion fails 2-3-0
        Mike moved to keep the status quo, rejecting the formal comment
        Kent seconded
        yes: Kent, Mike, Matthew
        no: Will
        abstain: Anton
