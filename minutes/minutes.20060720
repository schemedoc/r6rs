   - any other changes?
        hash-table-fold and list version not compatible?

            (Mike temporarily offline)
   - accept (with agreed-upon changes)?

        no objections to including them

6. I/O (10 minutes)
    several open issues
        how to deal with encoding errors
            Matthew and Will have responded, but Kent and Anton haven't
        meaning of EOF
        changes of encoding in mid-stream
            once-only mutation of input and output ports
        changes of buffering in mid-stream
        whither display?
        requiring explicit port arguments?
    need more discussion via email

5. multiple return values (10 minutes)

        Vote: yes, 4-1

     if yes, leave unspecified
     if no, proceed to second vote

     if no, proceed to third vote
   - third vote: accept Kent's proposed semantics
     if no, proceed to fourth vote
   - table for email discussion on hybrid solution, e.g., accepting
     will's suggestion to treat zero values as the unspecified value
     in single-value contexts and treat two or more values as an
     error in single value contexts
        tabled because Matthew isn't here

4. simplified condition type hierarchy (10 minutes)
   - should we go with existing hierarchy?
   - should we simplify?
     - see https://r6rs.scheming.org/node/242#comment-1362
        yes, we should simplify
        the relevant sub-editor (Mike) will propose something concrete

for next week:
set-car!, set-cdr!
safe/unsafe
i/o
body and library-body syntax
library syntax and phasing

8. adjourned about 3:39pm
