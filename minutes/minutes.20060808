3. future meetings (5 minutes)
   - Matthew is off to China next week (12 hours different from EDT)
        out of commission one week from today
        8am EDT might work (8pm in China, 3pm in Germany)
        Thursday next week, 8am EDT
   - Portland, OR in September (Scheme workshop / ICFP)
        Sunday evening at dinner,
            after talks end (5:30pm) and before R6RS session (8pm)
        maybe Monday evening as well

4. relaxation of script syntax (10 minutes)
   - treat script body as a library body?
     <script header>
     (import <import-spec>*)
     <library body>
     - requires (command-line) procedure
   - allow interleaved definitions and expressions?
    Anton volunteered to prepare written list of issues and options

5. syntax-case (15 minutes)
   - make fresh-syntax the default?
     - pros: reduces possibility of unintended intra-transformer capture
     - cons: complicates many common macros
             problematic interaction with quasisyntax
        adding fresh-syntax as a separate form:
            in: Will, Anton
            out: Kent, Mike, Matthew
   - add abstract transformer syntax?
       (transformer (<variable>) <body>) => transformer
        Will suggested "syntax-lambda" instead of "transformer"
        Mike suggested it be restricted to appear close to
            define-syntax (or whatever)
        adopted 4-0-1
   - add quasisyntax/unsyntax/unsyntax-splicing?
     - can be written as a macro
        can also be written incorrectly
        might improve acceptance of syntax-case
        adopted by acclamation
   - should let-syntax/letrec-syntax treated like begin or let?
        yes: Will, Kent, Matthew, Mike, Anton
        no: 
     (RKD: 'yes' means "treat like begin")
   - otherwise accept basically as is?
        accepted without objection

6. I/O convenience library (10 minutes)
   - naming of peek-char, write-char, etc.
        vote by email
        Will will propose a change to library semantics

7. I/O (15 minutes)
    extensibility
        file names
        file options
        transcoders
    mutation of port transcoders, transcoders, whatever

8. adjourned about 2:24pm
