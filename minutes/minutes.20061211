0. finalize agenda (1 minute)

2. closing tickets
   - when should a ticket be closed?
        when technical vote is settled
        agreement on formal response is separate

1. action items (1 minute)
   - look over numeric proposal (All)
        done; should be added to agenda
   - find and characterize (let () ---) examples (Will and Kent)
        done
   - split routine tickets into own files (Mike)
        done, except for ticket #74
   - comprehensive library phasing proposal, include characterization of
     the nature of allowable implementations (Matthew)
        not done
   - finish recording draft responses in svn tickets directory (All)
        done, except for technical issues
   - update #136 response to note that no top level is specified and that
     implementations who supply one (and probably most will) can provide
     a mechanism, possibly through imports, for addressing this comment (Kent)
        done
   - update response to rationalize the various iteration procedures [78] (Anton)
     - flush hash-table-fold
     - add hash-table->vector
     - vector-for-each, vector-map (same interface as for-each and map)
     - call/cc can be used for premature termination
     - (vector-map p (hash-table->vector ht)) and
       (vector-for-each p (hash-table->vector ht)) can be recognized by
       optimizer if implementor feels optimization is useful
     - problem: how does hash-table->vector return both keys and values?
        done, but issue remains
   - follow up with steering committee re: front page (Kent)
        done, but no response from them yet
   - insert readability and other guiding principles from
     status reports into draft R6RS (Mike)
        done

*. numeric proposal
    exact-expt, exact-sqrt
        flush exact-expt
        rename exact-sqrt to exact-integer-sqrt
    technical vote: 5-0

3. should we flush compound library names?
   - ticket 84
   - proposal in response: keep compound names
   - may need better rationale
        the current draft response is fine
    vote to accept current draft response: 5-0

4. record-type-length procedure
   - ticket 72
        vote to accept current draft response: 5-0

5. syntax-rules issues
   - tickets 111: syntax-rules should evaluate to a transformer
   - tickets 113: fenders should be dropped from syntax-rules
   - tickets 114: identifier macros with syntax-rules
   - summary of proposed response: Agreed:
     - make syntax-rules evaluate to a transformer
     - drop fenders from syntax-rules
        technical vote to drop: 5-0
     - allow _ (unparenthesized) pattern for syntax-rules
     - add make-variable-transformer to base library
        Will objects to having any procedural macros in (r6rs base)
    would also require exporting syntax-rules for expand
        from (r6rs base) library

        tabled

        ticket #49 not as problematic as the others
        technical vote on draft response to #49: 5-0
        Kent moved that we defer decisions on the others until
            after we have decided ticket #87, and that we defer
            decision on ticket #87 until after 15 December;
            should try to decide all by 15 January
