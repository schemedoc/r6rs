\chapter{Numbers}
\label{numbertypeschapter}
\mainindex{number}

This chapter describes Scheme's model for numbers.  It is important to
distinguish between the mathematical numbers, the Scheme objects that
attempt to model them, the machine representations used to implement
the numbers, and notations used to write numbers.  In this report, the
term \textit{number} refers to a mathematical number, and the term
\textit{number object} refers to a Scheme object representing a
number.  This report uses the types \type{complex}, \type{real},
\type{rational}, and \type{integer} to refer to both mathematical
numbers and number objects.  The \type{fixnum} and \type{flonum} types
refer to special subsets of the number objects, as determined by
common machine representations, as explained below.

\section{Numerical tower}
\label{numericaltypes}
\index{numerical types}

Numbers may be arranged into a tower of subsets in which each level
is a subset of the level above it:
\begin{tabbing}
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \=\tupe{number} \\
\> \tupe{complex} \\
\> \tupe{real} \\
\> \tupe{rational} \\
\> \tupe{integer} 
\end{tabbing}

For example, 5 is an integer.  Therefore 5 is also a rational,
a real, and a complex.  The same is true of the number objects
that model 5.  

Number objects are organized as a corresponding tower of subtypes
defined by the predicates {\cf number?}, {\cf complex?}, {\cf real?},
{\cf rational?}, and {\cf integer?}; see section~\ref{number?}.
Integer number objects are also called \defining{integer objects}.

There is no simple relationship between the subset that contains a
number and its representation inside a computer.  For example, the
integer 5 may have several representations.  Scheme's numerical
operations treat number objects as abstract data, as independent of
their representation as possible.  Although an implementation of
Scheme may use many different representations for numbers, this should
not be apparent to a casual programmer writing simple programs.

\section{Exactness}
\label{exactly}

\mainindex{exactness}It useful to distinguish between number objects
that are known to correspond to a number exactly, and those number
objects whose computation involved rounding or other errors.  For
example, index operations into data structures may need to know the index
exactly, as may some operations on polynomial coefficients in a symbolic algebra
system.  On the other hand, the results of measurements are inherently
inexact, and irrational numbers may be approximated by rational and
therefore inexact approximations.  In order to catch uses of numbers
known only inexactly where exact numbers are required, Scheme
explicitly distinguishes exact from inexact number objects.  This
distinction is orthogonal to the dimension of type.

Numbers objects are either \defining{exact} or \defining{inexact}.  A
number object is exact if it is the value of an exact numerical
literal or was derived from exact number objects using only exact
operations.  Exact number objects correspond to mathematical numbers
in the obvious way.

Conversely, a number object is inexact if it is the value of an
inexact numerical literal, or was derived from inexact number objects,
or was derived using inexact operations.  Thus inexactness is
contagious.

Exact arithmetic is reliable in the following sense: If exact number
objects are passed to any of the arithmetic procedures described in
section~\ref{propagationsection}, and an exact number object is
returned, then the result is mathematically correct.  This is
generally not true of computations involving inexact number objects
because approximate methods such as floating-point arithmetic may be
used, but it is the duty of each implementation to make the result as
close as practical to the mathematically ideal result.

\section{Fixnums and flonums}

A \defining{fixnum} is an exact integer object that lies
within a certain implementation-dependent subrange of the
exact integer objects. (Library section \extref{lib:fixnumssection}{Fixnums} describes a
library for computing with fixnums.)
Likewise, every implementation must
designate a subset of its inexact real number objects representing as \defining{flonum}s, and
to convert certain external representations into flonums.  
(Library section \extref{lib:flonumssection}{Flonums} describes a library for
computing with flonums.)  Note that
this does not imply that an implementation must use
floating-point representations.

\section{Implementation requirements}

\index{implementation restriction}\label{restrictions}

Implementations of Scheme must support number objects for
the entire tower of subtypes given in section~\ref{numericaltypes}.
Moreover, implementations must support exact integer 
objects and exact rational number objects of practically unlimited
size and precision, and to implement certain procedures (listed in
\ref{propagationsection}) so they always return exact results when
given exact arguments.  (``Practically unlimited'' means that the size
and precision of these numbers should only be limited by the size of
the available memory.)

Implementations may support only a limited range of inexact number
objects of any type, subject to the requirements of this section.  For
example, an implementation may limit the range of the inexact real
number objects (and therefore the range of inexact integer and
rational number objects) to the dynamic range of the flonum format.
Furthermore the gaps between the inexact integer objects and
rationals are likely to be very large in such an implementation as the
limits of this range are approached.

An implementation may use floating point and other approximate 
representation strategies for \tupe{inexact} numbers.
This report recommends, but does not require, that the IEEE 
floating-point standards be followed by implementations that use
floating-point representations, and that implementations using
other representations should match or exceed the precision achievable
using these floating-point standards~\cite{IEEE}.

In particular, implementations that use floating-point representations
must follow these rules: A floating-point result must be represented
with at least as much precision as is used to express any of the
inexact arguments to that operation.
Potentially inexact operations such as {\cf sqrt}, when
applied to exact arguments, should produce exact answers whenever possible
(for example the square root of an exact 4 ought to be an exact 2).
However, this is not required.
If, on the other hand, an exact number object is operated upon so as to produce an
inexact result (as by {\cf sqrt}), and if the result is represented in
floating point, then the most precise floating-point format available
must be used; but if the result is represented in some other way then
the representation must have at least as much precision as the most
precise floating-point format available.

It is the programmer's responsibility to avoid using inexact number
objects with magnitude or significand too large to be represented in
the implementation.

\section{Infinities and NaNs}

Positive infinity is regarded as a real (but not rational) number
object that represents an indeterminate number greater than the
numbers represented by all rational number objects.  Negative infinity
is regarded as a real (but not rational) number object that represents
an indeterminate number less than the numbers represented by all
rational numbers.

A NaN is regarded as a real (but not rational) number object so
indeterminate that it might represent any real number, including
positive or negative infinity, and might even be greater than positive
infinity or less than negative infinity.

\section{Distinguished -0.0}

Some Scheme implementations, specifically those that follow the IEEE
floating-point standards, distinguish between number objects for $0.0$
and $-0.0$, i.e., positive and negative inexact zero.  This report
will sometimes specify the behavior of certain arithmetic operations
on these number objects.  These specifications are marked with ``if
$-0.0$ is distinguished'' or ``implementations that distinguish
$-0.0$''.
