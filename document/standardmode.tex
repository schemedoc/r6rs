\chapter{Standard-conformant mode}
\label{standardconformantmode}

Scheme implementations compliant with the report may operate in a
variety of modes.  In particular, in addition to one or more modes
conformant with the requirements of the report, an implementation might
offer non-conformant modes.  These modes are by nature
implementation-specific, and may differ in the language and available
libraries.  In particular, non-conformant language extensions may be
available, including unsafe libraries or otherwise unsafe features, and the
semantics of the language may differ from the semantics described in
the report.  Moreover, the default mode offered by a Scheme
implementation may be non-conformant, and such a Scheme implementation
may require special settings or declarations to enter the
report-conformant mode.  Implementors are encouraged to clearly
document the nature of the default mode and how to enter
a report-conformant mode.
