\chapter{File system}
\label{filesystemchapter}

This chapter describes the \deflibrary{r6rs files} library for
operations on the file system.  This library, in addition to the
procedures described here, also exports the I/O condition types
described in section~\ref{iocondsection}.

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{file-exists?}{ filename}{procedure}}

\domain{\var{Filename} must be a filename (see
  section~\ref{filenamesection}).}  The {\cf file-exists?} procedure
returns \schtrue{} if the named file exists at the time the procedure
is called, \schfalse{} otherwise.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{delete-file}{ filename}{procedure}}

\domain{\var{Filename} must be a filename (see
  section~\ref{filenamesection}).}  The {\cf delete-file} procedure
deletes the named file if it exists and if it is possible, and returns
\unspecifiedreturn.  If the file does not exist or cannot be deleted,
an exception with condition type {\cf\&i/o-filename} is raised.
\end{entry}
