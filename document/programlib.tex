\section{Command-line access}
\label{programlibsection}

The procedure described in this section is exported by the
\deflibrary{r6rs programs} library.

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{command-line}{}{procedure}}

Returns a list of strings with
at least one element.  The first element is an implementation-specific
name for the running top-level program.  The following elements are command-line
arguments according to the operating system's conventions.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{exit}{}{procedure}
\rproto{exit}{ obj}{procedure}}

Exits the running program and communicates an exit value to the 
operating system.  If no argument is supplied, the {\cf exit}
procedure should communicate to the operating system that the program 
exited normally.  If an argument is supplied, the {\cf exit} procedure 
should translate the argument into an appropriate exit value for the 
operating system.
