\chapter{Scripts}
\label{scriptchapter}

A \defining{script} specifies an entry point for defining and running
a Scheme program.  A script specifies a set of libraries to import and
code to run.  Through the imported libraries, whether directly or the
transitive closure of importing, the script defines a complete Scheme
program.

Scripts follow the convention of many common platforms of accepting a
list of string \defining{command-line arguments} that may be used to
pass data to the script.  Moreover, a script can return an exact
integer specifying the script's \defining{exit value}.

A script is a delimited piece of text, typically a file, that follows
the following syntax:

\begin{grammar}
\meta{script header} \: \#!/usr/bin/env scheme-script
  \> \meta{linefeed}
  \> \meta{script substance}
\meta{script substance} \: \#!r6rs \meta{import form} \meta{script body}
  \> \| \meta{import form} \meta{script body}
\meta{import form} \: (import \arbno{\meta{import spec}})
\meta{script body} \: \arbno{\meta{script body form}} \meta{expression}
\meta{script body form} \: \meta{declaration}
\> \| \meta{definition}
\> \| \meta{expression}
\end{grammar}

The syntax of \meta{script header} is literal: the first line of a
script must contain exactly the characters specified in the rule.  The
remaining rules specify syntax at the form level.  

The \meta{import form} is identical to the import clause in
libraries (see section~\ref{librarysyntaxsection}), 
and specifies a set of libraries to import.  A \meta{script
  body} is like a \meta{library body} (see
section~\ref{librarybodysection}), except that declarations,
definitions and expressions may occur in any order, and that the final
form of the script body shall be an expression.  Thus, the syntax
specified by \meta{script body form} refers to the result of macro
expansion.

As with \hyper{library body}, a {\cf begin} form appearing in a
\hyper{script body} acts as a splicing form; see section~\ref{begin}.
In a \hyper{script body}, a {\cf begin} form may always appear without
operands.

A script is executed by treating the script similarly to a library, and
invoking it.  The semantics of a script body is explained by
translating it to a library body: All declarations at the script top
level are moved to the front, and apply to the entire script body.
Each expression \hyper{expression} that appears before definitions in
the script body is converted into a definition {\cf (define \hyper{id}
  \hyper{expression})} by choosing a fresh identifier \hyper{id}.

A script may access its command-line arguments by calling the {\cf
  command-line-arguments} procedure (see
section~\ref{command-line-arguments}).  The final expression of a
script shall return an exact integer, which becomes the exit value of
the script.  How that exit value is communicated to the environment is
implementation-specific.  When a script is invoked as a Unix or
Windows program, the exit value simply becomes the exit status of the
program.

If an exception with a {\cf\&serious} condition is raised during the
execution of the script, the default exception handler will behave as
described in section~\ref{exceptionssection}, and an
implementation-specific exit value will be communicated to the
environment.  On Unix, this value is according to the definition of
{\cf EX\_SOFTWARE} in the {\cf sysexits.h} header~\cite{srfi22}.
