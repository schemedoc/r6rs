\chapter{Composite library}
\label{complibchapter}

The \deflibrary{r6rs} library is a composite of most of the libraries
described in this report.  The only exceptions are:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item \library{r6rs records explicit} (section~\ref{recordsexplicitnamingsection})
\item \library{r6rs mutable-pairs} (chapter~\ref{pairmutationchapter})
\item \library{r6rs eval} (chapter~\ref{eval})
\item \library{r6rs r5rs} (chapter~\ref{r5rscompatchapter})
\end{itemize}
%
The library exports all procedures and syntactic forms provided by the
component libraries.

\begin{note}
  Even though \library{r6rs records explicit} is not
  included, \library{r6rs records implicit} is included, which
  subsumes the functionality of \library{r6rs records explicit}.
\end{note}

All of the bindings exported by \library{r6rs} are exported for both {\cf run}
and {\cf expand}; see report section~\ref{report:phasessection}.
