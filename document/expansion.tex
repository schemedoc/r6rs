\chapter{Expansion process}
\label{expansionchapter}

Macro uses (see section~\ref{macrosection}) are expanded into \textit{core
forms}\mainindex{core form} at the start of evaluation (before compilation or interpretation)
by a syntax \emph{expander}.
(The set of core forms is implementation-dependent, as is the
representation of these forms in the expander's output.)
If the expander encounters a syntactic abstraction, it invokes
the associated transformer to expand the syntactic abstraction, then
repeats the expansion process for the form returned by the transformer.
If the expander encounters a core form, it recursively
processes the subforms, if any, and reconstructs the form from the
expanded subforms.
Information about identifier bindings is maintained during expansion
to enforce lexical scoping for variables and keywords.

To handle internal definitions, the expander processes the initial
forms in a \hyper{body} (see section~\ref{bodiessection}) or
\hyper{library body} (see section~\ref{librarybodysection})
from left to
right.  How the expander processes each form encountered as it does so
depends upon the kind of form.

\begin{description}
\item[macro use]
The expander invokes the associated transformer to transform the macro
use, then recursively performs whichever of these actions are appropriate
for the resulting form.

\item[{\cf define-syntax} form]
The expander expands and evaluates the right-hand-side expression and binds the
keyword to the resulting transformer.

\item[{\cf define} form]
The expander records the fact that the defined identifier is a variable but defers
expansion of the right-hand-side expression until after all of the
definitions have been processed.

\item[{\cf begin} form]
The expander splices the subforms into the list of body forms it is
processing.  (See section~\ref{begin}.)

\item[{\cf let-syntax} or {\cf letrec-syntax} form]
The expander splices the inner body forms into the list of (outer) body forms it is
processing, arranging for the keywords bound by the {\cf let-syntax}
and {\cf letrec-syntax} to be visible only in the inner body forms.

\item[expression, i.e., nondefinition]
The expander completes the expansion of the deferred right-hand-side forms
and the current and remaining expressions in the body, then
creates the equivalent of a {\cf letrec*} form from the defined variables,
expanded right-hand-side expressions, and expanded body expressions.
\end{description}

Expansion of each variable definition right-hand side is deferred until
after all of the definitions have been seen so that each keyword and
variable reference within the right-hand side resolves to the local
binding, if any.

A definition in the sequence of forms must not define any identifier whose
binding is used to determine the meaning of the undeferred portions of the
definition or any definition that precedes it in the sequence of forms.
For example, the bodies of the following expressions violate this
restriction.

\begin{scheme}
(let ()
  (define define 17)
  (list define))

(let-syntax ([def0 (syntax-rules ()
                     [(\_ x) (define x 0)])])
  (let ([z 3])
    (def0 z)
    (define def0 list)
    (list z)))

(let ()
  (define-syntax foo
    (lambda (e)
      (+ 1 2)))
  (define + 2)
  (foo))
\end{scheme}

The following do not violate the restriction.

\begin{scheme}
(let ([x 5])
  (define lambda list)
  (lambda x x))         \ev  (5 5)

(let-syntax ([def0 (syntax-rules ()
                     [(\_ x) (define x 0)])])
  (let ([z 3])
    (define def0 list)
    (def0 z)
    (list z)))          \ev  (e)

(let ()
  (define-syntax foo
    (lambda (e)
      (let ([+ -]) (+ 1 2))))
  (define + 2)
  (foo))                \ev  -1
\end{scheme}

The implementation should treat a violation of the restriction as a
syntax violation.

% Andre's proposed implementation:
% To detect this violation, the expander can record each
% identifier whose denotation is determined during expansion
% of the body, together with the denotation.
% Before an identifier is bound, its current denotation is compared
% against denotations already used for the same (in the sense of
% bound-identifier=?) identifier in the scope of the intended binding,
% to determine if its current denotation has already been used
% during the expansion of the body.

Note that this algorithm does not directly reprocess any form.
It requires a single left-to-right pass over the definitions followed by a
single pass (in any order) over the body expressions and deferred
right-hand sides.

For example, in

\begin{scheme}
(lambda (x)
  (define-syntax defun
    (syntax-rules ()
      [(\_ (x . a) e) (define x (lambda a e))]))
  (defun (even? n) (or (= n 0) (odd? (- n 1))))
  (define-syntax odd?
    (syntax-rules () [(\_ n) (not (even? n))]))
  (odd? (if (odd? x) (* x x) x)))
\end{scheme}

The definition of {\cf defun} is encountered first, and the keyword
{\cf defun} is associated with the transformer resulting from
the expansion and evaluation of the corresponding right-hand side.
A use of {\cf defun} is encountered next and expands into a
{\cf define} form.
Expansion of the right-hand side of this define form is deferred.
The definition of {\cf odd?} is next and results in the association
of the keyword {\cf odd?} with the transformer resulting from
expanding and evaluating the corresponding right-hand side.
A use of {\cf odd?} appears next and is expanded; the resulting
call to {\cf not} is recognized as an expression
because {\cf not} is bound as a variable.
At this point, the expander completes the expansion of the current
expression (the {\cf not} call) and the deferred right-hand side of the
{\cf even?} definition;
the uses of {\cf odd?} appearing in these expressions are expanded
using the transformer associated with the keyword {\cf odd?}.
The final output is the equivalent of

\begin{scheme}
(lambda (x)
  (letrec* ([even?
              (lambda (n)
                (or (= n 0)
                    (not (even? (- n 1)))))])
    (not (even? (if (not (even? x)) (* x x) x)))))
\end{scheme}

although the structure of the output is implementation dependent.

Because definitions and expressions can be interleaved in a
\hyper{toplevel body} (see chapter~\ref{programchapter}),
the expander's processing of a \hyper{toplevel body} is somewhat
more complicated.
It behaves as described above for a \hyper{body} or
\hyper{library body} with the following exceptions.
When the expander finds a nondefinition,
it defers its expansion and continues scanning for definitions.
Once it reaches the end of the set of forms, it processes the
deferred right-hand-side and body expressions, then
residualizes the equivalent of a {\cf letrec*} form from the defined variables,
expanded right-hand-side expressions, and expanded body expressions.
For each body expression \hyper{expression} that appears before a variable definition
in the body, a dummy binding is created at the corresponding place within
the set of {\cf letrec*} bindings, with a fresh temporary variable on the
left-hand side and the equivalent of {\cf (begin \hyper{expression} (unspecified))}
on the right-hand side, so that
left-to-right evaluation order is preserved.
The {\cf begin} wrapper allows \hyper{expression} to evaluate to zero or more
values.
