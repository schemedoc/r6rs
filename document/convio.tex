\section{Simple I/O}
\label{simpleiosection}

This section describes the \defrsixlibrary{io simple} library, which
provides a somewhat more convenient interface for performing textual
I/O on ports.  This library implements most of the 
I/O procedures of the previous version of this report~\cite{R5RS}.

The ports created by the procedures of this library are textual ports
associated implementation-dependent transcoders.

\begin{entry}{%
\rproto{eof-object}{}{procedure}
\rproto{eof-object?}{ obj}{procedure}}

These are the same as {\cf eof-object} and {\cf eof-object?} from the
\rsixlibrary{ports} library.\schindex{eof-object}\schindex{eof-object?}
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{call-with-input-file}{ filename proc}{procedure}
\proto{call-with-output-file}{ filename proc}{procedure}}

\domain{\var{Proc} should accept one argument.}
These procedures open the file named by \var{filename} for input or
for output, with no specified file options, and call \var{proc} with
the obtained port as an argument.  If \var{proc} returns, the
port is closed automatically and the values returned by \var{proc} are
returned. If \var{proc} does not return, the port is not
closed automatically, unless it is possible to prove that the port
will never again be used for an I/O operation.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{%
\rproto{input-port?}{ obj}{procedure}
\rproto{output-port?}{ obj}{procedure}}

These are the same as the {\cf input-port?} and {\cf output-port?}
procedures in the \rsixlibrary{io ports} library.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{%
\rproto{current-input-port}{}{procedure}
\rproto{current-output-port}{}{procedure}
\rproto{current-error-port}{}{procedure}}
 
These are the same as the {\cf current-input-port}\schindex{current-input-port}, {\cf
  current-output-port}\schindex{current-output-port}, and {\cf current-error-port}\schindex{current-error-port} procedures from
the \rsixlibrary{io ports} library.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{with-input-from-file}{ filename thunk}{procedure}
\proto{with-output-to-file}{ filename thunk}{procedure}}

\domain{\var{Thunk} must be a procedure and should accept zero arguments.}  The
file is opened for input or output using empty file options, and
\var{thunk} is called with no arguments.  During the dynamic extent of
the call to \var{thunk}, the obtained port is made the value returned
by {\cf current-input-port} or {\cf current-output-port} procedures;
the previous default values are reinstated when the dynamic extent is
exited.  When \var{thunk} returns, the port is closed automatically,
and the previous values for {\cf current-input-port}.  The values
returned by \var{thunk} are returned.  If an escape procedure is used
to escape back into the call to \var{thunk} after \var{thunk} is
returned, the behavior is unspecified.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{open-input-file}{ filename}{procedure}}

This opens \var{filename} for input, with empty file options, and returns
the obtained port.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{open-output-file}{ filename}{procedure}}

This opens \var{filename} for output, with empty file options, and
returns the obtained port.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{close-input-port}{ input-port}{procedure}
\proto{close-output-port}{ output-port}{procedure}}

This closes \var{input-port} or \var{output-port}, respectively.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{read-char}{}{procedure}
\rproto{read-char}{ textual-input-port}{procedure}}

This reads from \var{textual-input-port},
blocking as necessary until a character
is available from \var{textual-input-port},
or the data that are available cannot
be the prefix of any valid encoding, or an end of file is reached.

If a complete character is available before the next end of file, {\cf
  read-char} returns that character, and updates the input port to
point past that character. If an end of file is
reached before any data are read, {\cf read-char} returns the
end-of-file object.

If \var{textual-input-port} is omitted, it defaults to the value returned by
{\cf current-input-port}.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{%
\rproto{peek-char}{}{procedure}
\proto{peek-char}{ textual-input-port}{procedure}}
   
This is the same as {\cf read-char}, but does not consume any data
from the port.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{%
\rproto{read}{}{procedure}
\proto{read}{ textual-input-port}{procedure}}

Reads an external representation from \var{textual-input-port}
and returns the datum it
represents.  The {\cf read} procedure operates in the same way as 
{\cf get-datum}, see section~\ref{get-datum}.

If \var{textual-input-port} is omitted, it defaults to the value returned by
{\cf current-input-port}.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{write-char}{ char}{procedure}
\rproto{write-char}{ char textual-output-port}{procedure}}

Writes an encoding of the character \var{char} to the
\var{textual-output-port}.  This returns \unspecifiedreturn.

If \var{textual-output-port} is omitted, it defaults to the value returned by
{\cf current-output-port}.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{newline}{}{procedure}
\rproto{newline}{ textual-output-port}{procedure}}

This is equivalent to using {\cf write-char} to write
{\cf \#\backwhack{}linefeed}
to \var{textual-output-port}.

If \var{textual-output-port} is omitted, it defaults to the value returned by
{\cf current-output-port}.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{display}{ obj}{procedure}
\rproto{display}{ obj textual-output-port}{procedure}}

Writes a representation of \var{obj} to the given \var{textual-output-port}.
Strings that appear in
the written representation are not enclosed in doublequotes, and no
characters are escaped within those strings.  Character objects appear
in the representation as if written by {\cf write-char} instead of by
{\cf write}.  The {\cf display} procedure returns \unspecifiedreturn.  The
\var{textual-output-port} argument may be omitted, in which case it defaults
to the value returned by {\cf current-output-port}.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{write}{ obj}{procedure}
\rproto{write}{ obj textual-output-port}{procedure}}

Writes the external representation of \var{obj} to \var{textual-output-port}.
The {\cf write}
procedure operates in the same way as {\cf put-datum}; see
section~\ref{put-datum}.

If \var{textual-output-port} is omitted, it defaults to the value returned by
{\cf current-output-port}.
\end{entry}
