This chapter describes the \defrsixlibrary{sorting} library for
sorting lists and vectors.

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{list-sort}{ proc list}{procedure}
\proto{vector-sort}{ proc vector}{procedure}}

\domain{\var{Proc} should accept any two elements
  of the list or vector, and should not have any side
  effects.}  \var{Proc} should return a true value when its first argument
is strictly less than its second, and \schfalse{} otherwise.

The {\cf list-sort} and {\cf vector-sort} procedures perform a stable
sort of \var{list} or \var{vector} in ascending order according to
\var{proc}, without changing \var{list} or
\var{vector} in any way.  The {\cf list-sort} procedure returns a
list, and {\cf vector-sort} returns a vector.  The results may be {\cf
  eq?} to the argument when the argument is already sorted, and the
result of {\cf list-sort} may share structure with a tail of the
original list.  The sorting algorithm performs $O(n \lg n)$ calls to
\var{proc} where $n$ is the length of \var{list} or \var{vector},
and all arguments passed to \var{proc} are elements of the list or
vector being sorted, but the pairing of arguments and the sequencing
of calls to \var{proc} are not specified.
If multiple returns occur from {\cf list-sort} or {\cf vector-sort}, the return
values returned by earlier returns are not mutated.

\begin{scheme}
(list-sort < '(3 5 2 1)) \ev (1 2 3 5)
(vector-sort < '\sharpsign(3 5 2 1)) \ev \sharpsign(1 2 3 5)%
\end{scheme}

\implresp The implementation must check the restrictions
on \var{proc} to the extent performed by applying it as described.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{vector-sort!}{ proc vector}{procedure}}

\domain{\var{Proc} should accept any two elements
  of the vector, and should not have any side
  effects.}  \var{Proc} should return a true value when its first
argument is strictly less than its second, and \schfalse{} otherwise.

The {\cf vector-sort!} procedure destructively sorts \var{vector} in
ascending order according to \var{proc}.  The sorting algorithm
performs $O(n^2)$ calls to \var{proc} where $n$ is the length of
\var{vector}, and all arguments passed to \var{proc} are elements
of the vector being sorted, but the pairing of arguments and the
sequencing of calls to \var{proc} are not specified.  The sorting
algorithm may be unstable.  The procedure returns \unspecifiedreturn.

\begin{scheme}
(define v (vector 3 5 2 1))
(vector-sort! v) \ev \theunspecified
v \ev \sharpsign(1 2 3 5)
\end{scheme}
\implresp The implementation must check the restrictions
on \var{proc} to the extent performed by applying it as described.
