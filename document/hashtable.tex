\chapter{Hashtables}
\label{hashtablechapter}

The \defrsixlibrary{hashtables} library provides hashtables.
A \defining{hashtable} is a data structure that associates keys with values.
Any object can be used as a key, provided a \defining{hash function}
and a suitable \defining{equivalence function} is available.  A hash function is a
procedure that maps
keys to integers.
It is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that the hash function
is compatible with the equivalence function,
which is a procedure that accepts two keys and returns true if they
are equivalent, otherwise returns \schfalse{}.
Standard hashtables for arbitrary objects based on the {\cf eq?} and 
{\cf eqv?} predicates (see report section~\extref{report:equivalencesection}{Equivalence predicates}) are provided.  
Also, standard hash functions for several types are provided.

This section uses the \var{hashtable} parameter name for arguments
that must be hashtables, and the \var{key} parameter name for
arguments that must be hashtable keys.

\section{Constructors}

\mainindex{hashtable}

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{make-eq-hashtable}{}{procedure}
\rproto{make-eq-hashtable}{ \var{k}}{procedure}}

Returns a newly allocated mutable hashtable that accepts
arbitrary objects as keys,
and compares those keys with {\cf eq?}. If an argument is given, the initial 
capacity of the hashtable is set to approximately \var{k} elements.

\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{make-eqv-hashtable}{}{procedure}
\rproto{make-eqv-hashtable}{ \var{k}}{procedure}}

Returns a newly allocated mutable hashtable that accepts
arbitrary objects as keys,
and compares those keys with {\cf eqv?}.
If an argument is given, the initial 
capacity of the hashtable is set to approximately \var{k} elements.

\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{make-hashtable}{ \var{hash-function} \var{equiv}}{procedure}
\rproto{make-hashtable}{ \var{hash-function} \var{equiv} \var{k}}{procedure}}

\domain{\var{Hash-function} and \var{equiv} must be procedures.
\var{Hash-function} will be called by other procedures described in
this chapter with a key as argument, and should return a 
non-negative exact integer.
\var{Equiv} will be called by other procedures described in
this chapter with two keys as arguments, and should return a single
value.
Both procedures should not mutate the hashtable returned by {\cf make-hashtable}.}
The {\cf make-hashtable} procedure returns a newly allocated mutable
hashtable using \var{hash-function} 
as the hash function and \var{equiv} as the equivalence function used to 
compare keys.
If a third argument is given, the 
initial capacity of the hashtable is set to approximately \var{k} elements.

Both the hash function \var{hash-function} and the equivalence
function \var{equiv} should behave like pure functions
on the domain of keys.  For example, the {\cf string-hash}
and {\cf string=?} procedures are permissible only if all
keys are strings and the contents of those strings are never
changed so long as any of them continues to serve as a key in
the hashtable.  Furthermore, any pair of values for which
the equivalence function \var{equiv} returns true should
be hashed to the same exact integers by 
\var{hash-function}.

\implresp The implementation must check the restrictions on
\var{hash-function} and \var{equiv} to the extent performed by
applying them as described.

\begin{note}
Hashtables are allowed to cache the results of calling the
hash function and equivalence function, so programs cannot
rely on the hash function being called for every lookup or
update.  Furthermore any hashtable operation may call the
hash function more than once.
\end{note}

\begin{rationale}
Hashtable lookups are often followed by updates, so caching
may improve performance.  Hashtables are free to change
their internal representation at any time, which may result
in many calls to the hash function.
\end{rationale}

\end{entry}

\section{Procedures}

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{hashtable?}{ \var{hashtable}}{procedure}}

Returns \schtrue{} if \var{hashtable} is a hashtable.
Otherwise, returns \schfalse{}.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{\proto{hashtable-size}{ \var{hashtable}}{procedure}}

Returns the number of keys contained in \var{hashtable} as an exact integer.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{hashtable-ref}{ \var{hashtable} \var{key} \var{default}}{procedure}}

Returns the value in \var{hashtable} associated with \var{key}.
If \var{hashtable} does not contain an association for \var{key},
then \var{default} is returned.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{\proto{hashtable-set!}{ \var{hashtable} \var{key} \var{obj}}{procedure}}

Changes \var{hashtable} to associate \var{key} with \var{obj},
adding a new association or replacing any existing association for \var{key},
and returns \unspecifiedreturn.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{\proto{hashtable-delete!}{ \var{hashtable} \var{key}}{procedure}}

Removes any association for \var{key} within \var{hashtable}, and
returns the \unspecifiedreturn.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{\proto{hashtable-contains?}{ \var{hashtable} \var{key}}{procedure}}

Returns \schtrue{} if \var{hashtable} contains an association
for \var{key}.  Otherwise, returns \schfalse{}.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{hashtable-update!}{ \var{hashtable} \var{key} \var{proc} \var{default}}{procedure}}

\domain{\var{Proc} must be a procedure that accepts a single argument.
  It should not mutate \var{hashtable}.}
The {\cf hashtable-update!} procedure applies \var{proc} to the value in \var{hashtable}
associated with \var{key}, 
or to \var{default} if \var{hashtable} does not contain an
association for \var{key}.
The \var{hashtable} is then changed to associate \var{key}
with the result of \var{proc}.

The behavior of {\cf hashtable-update!} is equivalent to the
following code, but may be implemented 
more efficiently in cases where the implementation can
avoid multiple lookups of the same key:
\begin{scheme}
(hashtable-set!
 hashtable key
 (proc (hashtable-ref
        hashtable key default)))
\end{scheme}
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{hashtable-copy}{ \var{hashtable}}{procedure}
\rproto{hashtable-copy}{ \var{hashtable} \var{mutable}}{procedure}}

Returns a copy of \var{hashtable}.  If the
\var{mutable} argument is provided and is true, the returned hashtable is mutable;
otherwise it is immutable.

\begin{rationale}
Hashtable references may be less expensive with immutable hashtables.
Also, the creator of a hashtable may wish to prevent 
modifications, particularly by code outside of the creator's 
control.
\end{rationale}

\end{entry}
\begin{entry}{%
\proto{hashtable-clear!}{ \var{hashtable}}{procedure}
\rproto{hashtable-clear!}{ \var{hashtable} \var{k}}{procedure}}

Removes all associations from \var{hashtable} and returns \unspecifiedreturn.

If a second argument is given, the current
capacity of the hashtable is reset to approximately \var{k} elements.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{\proto{hashtable-keys}{ \var{hashtable}}{procedure}}

Returns a vector of all keys in \var{hashtable}.
The order of the vector is unspecified.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{hashtable-entries}{ \var{hashtable}}{procedure}}

Returns two values, a vector of the keys in \var{hashtable}, and a
vector of the corresponding values.

\begin{scheme}
(let ((h (make-eqv-hashtable)))
  (hashtable-set! h 1 'one)
  (hashtable-set! h 2 'two)
  (hashtable-set! h 3 'three)
  (hashtable-entries h)) \lev \sharpsign(1 2 3), \sharpsign(one two three)\\\>; two return values%
\end{scheme}
\end{entry}

\section{Inspection}

\begin{entry}{\proto{hashtable-equivalence-function}{ \var{hashtable}}{procedure}}

Returns the equivalence function used by
\var{hashtable} to compare keys.  For hashtables
created with {\cf make-eq-hashtable} and {\cf make-eqv-hashtable},
returns {\cf eq?} and {\cf eqv?} respectively.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{\proto{hashtable-hash-function}{ \var{hashtable}}{procedure}}

Returns the hash function used by \var{hashtable}.
For hashtables created by {\cf make-eq-hashtable} 
or {\cf make-eqv-hashtable}, \schfalse{} is returned.

\begin{rationale}
The {\cf make-eq-hashtable} and {\cf make-eqv-hashtable} constructors
are designed to hide their hash function.  This allows implementations
to use the machine address of an object as its hash value, rehashing
parts of the table as necessary whenever the garbage collector moves
objects to a different address.
\end{rationale}
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{\proto{hashtable-mutable?}{ \var{hashtable}}{procedure}}

Returns \schtrue{} if \var{hashtable} is mutable, otherwise returns \schfalse{}.
\end{entry}

\section{Hash functions}

The {\cf equal-hash}, {\cf string-hash}, and {\cf string-ci-hash}
procedures of this section are acceptable as hash functions only
if the keys on which they are called do not suffer side effects
while the hashtable remains in use.

\begin{entry}{\proto{equal-hash}{ \var{obj}}{procedure}}

Returns an integer hash value for \var{obj}, based on
its structure and current contents.  This hash function is suitable
for use with {\cf equal?} as an equivalence function.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{\proto{string-hash}{ \var{string}}{procedure}}

Returns an integer hash value for \var{string}, based on
its current contents.
This hash function is suitable
for use with {\cf string=?} as an equivalence function.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{\proto{string-ci-hash}{ \var{string}}{procedure}}

Returns an integer hash value for \var{string} based on
its current contents, ignoring case.
This hash function is suitable
for use with {\cf string-ci=?} as an equivalence function.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{\proto{symbol-hash}{ \var{symbol}}{procedure}}

Returns an integer hash value for \var{symbol}.
\end{entry}
