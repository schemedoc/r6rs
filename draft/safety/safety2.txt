Current Proposals for Safe/Unsafe Mode and Declarations
=======================================================


Goals
=====

We want to make it easier for people to write Scheme
programs and to debug them.

We want to make it easier for people to write portable
programs in Scheme.

We want to tell people that Scheme is buzzword-compatible.


How Safe Mode Contributes to Goals
==================================

Reliable detection of programmed errors ("bugs") makes it
easier to debug and to write programs.

Reliable detection of violations of the language standard
makes it harder for people to write non-portable programs,
whether by accident or on purpose.

Reliable detection of bugs and violations makes it easier
for people to maintain a straight face when claiming that
Scheme is strongly typed.


How Unsafe Mode Contributes to Goals
====================================

Not checking for bugs makes it easier to write Scheme
programs that run fast or interact with unsafe legacy
code.  In some cases, not checking for bugs may be the
best way to accomplish some task using Scheme instead
of using some language that would be much less safe.

Not checking for violations makes it easier for systems
to provide features that are absent from the language
standard, and to experiment with extensions that may
become standard in the future.

Not checking for bugs and violations makes it easier
to claim that Scheme has feature X "in practice", or
that Scheme programs run as fast as programs written
in language Y.


Tentative Design
================

Design of the so-called safe and unsafe modes interacts
strongly with the exception and condition systems, and
to some extent with the library and macro systems.

In what follows, I will assume a hierarchy of condition
types, as in SRFI 35.  For this note, I will assume the
following specific hierarchy of conditions (with tree
structure implied by indentation):

&condition
  &message
    &warning
  &serious
    &error
      &implementation-restriction
      ...
    &violation
      &nonstandard
      &defect
        &lexical
        &syntax
        &domain
        &result
        ...

The R6RS will refer to many condition types not shown above,
but the examples above should give you some idea.

We should extend or revise the R5RS classification of
situations that are relevant to safety or portability.
The word "error" evidently carries some baggage, so we
might want to avoid it.  Here is one possible rephrasing
of the R5RS classification:

*  "must raise a ZYX exception" means that, in safe mode,
implementations must detect the situation and raise an
exception with a condition of type ZYX.

*  "should raise a ZYX exception" means that implementations
are encouraged, but not required, to detect the situation
and to raise an exception with a condition of type ZYX.

*  "may raise a ZYX exception" means that implementations
are allowed, but not required or encouraged, to detect
the situation and to raise an exception with a condition
of type ZYX.

*  "might raise a ZYX exception" means that implementations
are allowed, but discouraged, to detect the situation
and to raise an exception with a condition of type ZYX.

*  "returns an unspecified value" means that the value
to be returned is not specified for the situation, but
implementations are not allowed to raise an exception.

If an implementation is unable to perform an action or
return a value in a way compatible with the R6RS, then
it must raise an &implementation-restriction exception.

We should use some such classification to re-classify
every situation that the R5RS describes as signalling
an error, an error, a violation of an implementation
restriction, having unspecified or undefined effect,
or yielding an unspecified value.  We should also
classify some situations that the R5RS overlooked,
such as syntax errors.

We should specify every situation in which a conforming
implementation of Scheme is required to raise an exception,
and should also identify situations in which a conforming
implementation is allowed to raise an exception.  We should
also specify a condition type for the condition that is to
be raised in each identified situation.  Assuming a design
similar to SRFI 35, implementations would then be free to
use any sub-condition-type of the specified condition, and
to combine them with arbitrarily many other condition
types.

We should insist that the default exception handlers
report certain kinds of exceptions.  Programmers will
be able to override the default handlers using some
mechanism that resembles that of SRFI 34.

The R6RS should also allow implementations to provide ways
for programmers to escape from the semantics of R6RS Scheme
into implementation-dependent and possibly unsafe modes that
may not perform all of run-time checks that are required in
R6RS Scheme.

For example, a programmer might use a syntax such as
#!chez to declare that #3(a b c) should be treated as
#(a b c) when read by the READ procedure.

For another example, a programmer might use one of these
implementation-specific declarations to declare that the
operations exported from a standard fixnum library may
not detect, let alone report, &domain conditions.  Even
if they do detect the condition, they might handle it in
ways that cannot even be expressed in R6RS Scheme, for
example by returning an incorrect answer or incurring a
segmentation fault.

Many of these implementation-specific declarations are
likely to have static rather than dynamic scope.  There
are several ways to explain this, and several proposals
are currently under consideration.  See "Declaration
Semantics" below.

One of the guiding principles of the most recent drafts
of the R6RS status report says we will provide some
standard way to declare whether run-time safety checks
are desired.  This can be done by extending the library
mechanism to allow such declarations, and by devising
a syntax for such declarations that has some portable
semantics while leaving room for implementations to
interpret the details as they see fit.

Such declarations could also be allowed to appear at the
head of any body that permits internal definitions.


Declaration Syntax
==================

This section is still tentative because of interactions
with library syntax.  For now, let us suppose that the
<library-body> syntax will be

<library-body> = <declaration>* <command-or-definition>*

and that the <body> and <definition> syntax of R5RS will
be changed to

<body> --> <declaration>* <definition>* <sequence>
<definition> --> (define <variable> <expression>)
      | (define (<variable> <def formals>) <body>)
      | (begin <declaration>* <definition>*)

The scope of a declaration is the library in which it
appears, the expression that immediately surrounds the
<body> at whose head it appears, or the group of
definitions at whose head it appears.

The current proposal for declaration syntax is

<declaration> --> (declare <declarespec>*)
<declarespec> --> unsafe
                | <quality>
                | (<quality> <priority>)
<quality> --> safe | fast | small | debug
<priority> --> 0 | 1 | 2 | 3

Priority 3 is the highest priority.  Priority 0 means
the quality is not a priority at all.

The unsafe <declarespec> is a synonym for (safe 0).
The safe <declarespec> is a synonym for (safe 3), and
similarly for fast, small, and debug.


Declaration Pragmatics
======================

For safe, the default priority must be 1 or higher.
When the priority for safe is 1 or higher, implementations
must raise all required exceptions and let them be handled
by the usual R6RS exception mechanism.

Beyond that, the detailed interpretation of declarations
will vary in different implementations.  In particular,
implementations are free to ignore declarations, and
may observe some declarations while ignoring others.

(One possible exception to the above is that we may want
to require implementations that implement an unsafe mode
to pay attention to any declarations that increase the
safe priority within an unsafe section of code.)

The following descriptions of each quality may provide
some guidance for programmers and implementors.

safe
====

This quality's priority influences the degree of checking
for exceptional situations, and the raising and handling
of exceptions in response to those situations.  The higher
the priority, the more likely an exception will be raised.

At priority 0, an implementation is allowed to ignore any
R6RS requirements for raising an exception.  In situations
for which the R6RS allows or requires the implementation
to raise an exception, the implementation may ignore the
situation and continue the computation with an incorrect
result, may terminate the computation in an unpleasant
fashion, or may destroy the invariants of run-time data
structures in ways that cause unexpected and mysterious
misbehavior even in code that comes within the scope of
a safe declaration.  All bets are off.

At priority 1 and higher, an implementation must raise all
exceptions required by the R6RS, handle those exceptions
using the exception mechanism described by the R6RS, and
use the default exception handlers described by the R6RS.

At higher priorities, implementations may be more likely
to raise exceptions that are allowed but not required by
the R6RS.

Most implementations are able to recognize some violations
when parsing, expanding macros, or compiling a definition
or expression whose evaluation has not yet commenced in
the usual sense.  Implementations are allowed to use
nonstandard exception handlers at those times, and are
encouraged to raise &lexical and &syntax exceptions for
violations detected at those times, even if the definition
or expression that contains the violation will never be
executed.  Implementations are also allowed to raise a
&warning exception at those times if they determine that
some subexpression would inevitably raise some kind of
&violation exception were it ever to be evaluated.

fast
====

This quality's priority influences the speed of the code
it governs.  At high priorities, the code is likely to
run faster, but that improvement is constrained by other
qualities and may come at the expense of the small and
debug qualities.

small
=====

This quality's priority influences the amount of computer
memory needed to represent and to run the code.  At high
priorities, the code is likely to occupy less memory and
to require less memory during evaluation.

debug
=====

This quality's priority influences the programmer's ability
to debug the code.  At high priorities, the programmer is
more likely to understand the correspondence between the
original source code and information displayed by debugging
tools.  At low priorities, some debugging tools may not be
usable.


Declaration Semantics
=====================

The semantics of the fast, small, and debug qualities is
entirely implementation-dependent, but there have been
several proposals to mandate some semantics for the safe
quality, which would remain largely implementation-dependent
in any of those proposals.

The following sections describe the informal semantics of
four proposals.  Those sections are followed by sections
that sketch what a more formal semantics of those proposals
might look like.  Finally, a section considers several
examples on which the proposals might differ.


Proposal 0: Informal Semantics
==============================

The semantics of unsafe code is unspecified, as it is
beyond the scope of R6RS.

Rationale:  The purpose of unsafe code is to provide
an escape from the R6RS semantics.  The R6RS does not
have to, and literally cannot, describe the semantics
of code that is not subject to the R6RS semantics.

Note:  With Proposal 0, we could honestly say that
R6RS Scheme is a safe language, because we will have
defined unsafe code to lie outside the language that
is described by the R6RS.


Proposal 1: Informal Semantics
==============================

Every implementation is required to provide a second,
unsafe version of every standard library, named by a
second name that indicates the library is potentially
unsafe, e.g. r6rs/unsafe.  These unsafe versions of the
standard libraries are allowed to be the same as the
safe ones, but are also allowed to be unsafe in various
ways that might be expressed by implementation-specific
means and/or unsafe (safe 0) declarations.

Scripts and libraries that wish to use unsafe versions
of the standard libraries will name the unsafe versions.

Within a script or library, an unsafe (safe 0) declaration
means that, within the scope of the declaration (determined
after macro expansion), any situation that, in the words
of the R6RS, must raise an exception is allowed not to
raise an exception.

Note:  This is Orwellian doublespeak.  Proposals 2 and 3
feature the same doublespeak.

For example, if unsafe code defines a procedure of two
arguments and then calls that procedure with only one
argument, then an exception might not be raised.


Proposal 2: Informal Semantics
==============================

Every procedure provides a second, unsafe entry point
that may be used when the procedure is called from
unsafe code.  These unsafe entry points may be the
same as or equivalent to the safe entry points, but
are also allowed to be unsafe in various ways that
might be expressed by implementation-specific means
and/or unsafe (safe 0) declarations.

Within a script or library, an unsafe (safe 0) declaration
means that, within the scope of the declaration (determined
after macro expansion), any situation that, in the words
of the R6RS, must raise an exception is allowed not to
raise an exception.

In addition, procedure calls that occur within the
scope of an unsafe (safe 0) declaration may use the
unsafe entry point of the callee.


Proposal 3: Informal Semantics
==============================

Every imported identifier x has two bindings, a safe
binding and an unsafe binding.  References to x in safe
code (determined at the source level, i.e., prior to macro
expansion) resolve to the safe binding, while references
to x in unsafe source code resolve to the unsafe binding.
The unsafe binding may be the same as the safe binding
but is also allowed to differ in following ways.

If x is a variable and the value of x's safe binding
is a procedure p, the value of x's unsafe binding is a
procedure q that might not raise exceptions in cases where
p is required to raise exceptions.  q is not otherwise
distinguishable from p.

If x is a keyword, a syntactic form identified by a
reference to x in unsafe mode behaves the same as an
identical syntactic form identified by a reference to x
in safe mode except the former might not raise exceptions
in cases where the latter is required to raise exceptions.

For example, the unsafe version of car is not required to
raise an exception if passed a non-pair argument, and the
unsafe version of lambda may evaluate to a procedure that
does not raise an excpetion if passed an incorrect number
of arguments.


Proposal 0: Sketch of Formal Semantics
======================================

For Proposal 0, no formal semantics is necessary or
desired.


Proposal 1: Sketch of Formal Semantics
======================================

Proposal 2 requires the macro expander to pass declare
forms through to the output, but otherwise to ignore
their presence.

The formal semantics of R6RS will be adequate for the
explicitly named unsafe versions of standard libraries.

In addition, the formal semantics of R6RS Scheme would
be extended as follows.

If the formal semantics of R6RS were denotational,
along the lines of the R5RS formal semantics, then
the domain equation for environments can be extended
by adding a boolean (or one of the integers 0, 1, 2, 3)
to indicate whether an expression appears within the
scope of an unsafe declaration (or safe 0, 1, 2, 3),
and the operations on the environment ADT would be
changed accordingly.  Wherever the formal semantics
would indicate the mandatory raising of an exception,
the semantics would be changed to something like

    if safe \rho
       then raise <condition> \sigma
       else wrong <condition> \sigma

where raise encapsulates the semantics of raising an
exception with the specified condition, and wrong is
the command continuation of the R5RS semantics that
indicates unspecified behavior.

The semantics of a safe (or unsafe) declaration would
be to produce a new environment \rho' from \rho for
which safe \rho' would return the boolean indicating
whether this is safe code.

It is equally straightforward to do this for the kind
of small-step operational semantics we envision for the
R6RS.


Proposal 2: Sketch of Formal Semantics
======================================

Proposal 2 requires the macro expander to pass declare
forms through to the output, but otherwise to ignore
their presence.

Proposal 2 entails the semantic changes (but not the
library changes) that were sketched for Proposal 1,
together with the following changes.

The R5RS domain equation for procedures would be extended
by adding a second entry point:

    F = L x (E* -> K -> C) x (E* -> K -> C)

The applicate operation of the semantics would be given
an extra argument, safe \rho, which it would use to select
between the two entry points.

The semantics of lambda expressions would be changed to
construct both entry points.  The semantics for both
entry points would be the same, but the nondeterminism
that readers of the semantics are asked to perceive in
the wrong continuation would allow the behavior of the
two entry points to differ.  (This nondeterminism could
be made explicit via power domains, but that level of
formality was not considered necessary when a formal
semantics was first added to the Scheme report.)

It is even more straightforward (because of nondeterminism)
to do this for the kind of small-step operational semantics
we envision for the R6RS.


Proposal 3: Sketch of Formal Semantics
======================================

Proposal 3 requires that the macro expander recognize
library references to identifiers that appear in safe mode
and select the safe or unsafe binding, as appropriate.

For example,

    (lambda (x)
      (declare (safe 0))
      (let ((y (cdr x)))
        (declare (safe 1))
        (car y)))

expands to

    (#u:lambda (x)
      (#u:let ((y (#u:cdr x)))
        (#s:car x)))

where #u:lambda is a reference to the unsafe binding of
lambda, #u:cdr is a reference to the unsafe binding of cdr,
and #s:car is a reference to the safe binding of car.

The semantics of core syntactic forms is as sketched in
Proposal 1 except that the environment need not be used to
keep track of the safe quality, which is recorded directly
in the expander output.


Comparison of the Four Proposals
================================

With Proposal 0, the semantics of programs that execute
unsafe code would not be specified.  Instead of repeating
that for every example, this section will ignore Proposal 0.

Within this section, the phrase "will raise an exception"
means that the semantics of a proposal requires that an
exception be raised.  (The more intuitive phrase, "must
raise an exception", has already been given the
counter-intuitive meaning that an exception is required
in safe mode, but not in unsafe.)

We now consider illustrative examples.

The following example will raise an exception with any of
Proposals 1, 2, and 3:

    (begin
      (declare unsafe)
      (let ((x (+ 3)))
        (declare safe)
        (+ 'b)))

Similarly, the following example will raise an exception
with any of Proposals 1, 2, and 3:

    (let ()
      (declare unsafe)
      (+ 'a (begin (declare safe) (+ 'b))))

The following example will raise an exception with Proposal
1, but might not raise an exception with Proposals 2 or 3
because those proposals do not require an exception to be
raised for the commented line, and failure to detect the
problem with the commented line causes unspecified behavior
for subsequent calls:

    (let ()
      (declare unsafe)
      (let ((x (+ 'a)))    ; might not raise an exception
        (declare safe)
        (+ 'b)))

With Proposals 1 and 2, and 3, the following expression
returns #t.

    (eqv? (let () (declare safe) +)
          (let () (declare unsafe) +))

The following example is not required to raise an exception
with any of Proposals 1, 2, or 3:

    (let ((my-name "abc"))
      (declare unsafe)
      (my-name 1 2 3))

With Proposals 1, 2, and 3, it is not entirely clear
whether the following example is required to raise an
exception.  With the formal semantics sketched above,
Proposals 1, 2, and 3 would require an exception to be
raised when the safe my-memq procedure is called with
an incorrect number of arguments.

Will, however, considers the R5RS semantics' placement
of that check within the procedure value to have been
a matter of convenience for the author of that semantics
(namely Will), as it did not matter where the check was
placed when the R5RS and earlier reports did not actually
require the check.  Will believes that implementations
should be given freedom to perform that check at the
call site, which in this example lies within unsafe
code.

    (let ()
      (define (my-memq x things)
        (cond ((null? things) #f)
              ((eq? x (car things)) things)
              (else (my-memq x (cdr things)))))
      (let ()
        (declare unsafe)
        (my-memq 1 2 3)))

The following example is a variation of the preceding,
and all of the remarks that applied to the preceding
example apply to this one.

    (let ()
      (define (my-memq x things)
        (cond ((null? things) #f)
              ((eq? x (car things)) things)
              (else (my-memq x (cdr things)))))
      (define-syntax my-memq-macro
        (syntax-rules ()
         ((_ . args)
          (my-memq . args))))
      (let ()
        (declare unsafe)
        (my-memq-macro 1 2 3)))

The following example will raise an exception with any of
Proposals 1, 2, and 3:

    (let ()
      (declare unsafe)
      (let ((g (lambda (x)
                 (declare safe)
                 (car x))))
        (g 'a)))

The following example will raise an exception with any of
Proposals 1, 2, and 3:

    (let ()
      (define (f)
        (declare unsafe)
        (let ((g (lambda (x)
                   (declare safe)
                   (car x))))
          g))
      (let ((g (f)))
        (g 'a)))

The following example will raise an exception with Proposal
1, but might not with Proposals 2 and 3 (assuming for
Proposal 1 that the safe version of - was imported):

    (let ()
      (declare safe)
      (let ((f -))
        (declare unsafe)
        (- 'a)))

The following two examples will raise an exception with
Proposal 3 but might not with Proposal 2, illustrating that
the safety of an operator is determined at the reference
site in Proposal 3 and at the call site in Proposal 2.
They will raise an exception with Proposal 1 if the safe
version of - was imported but might not otherwise.

    (let ()
      (declare safe)
      (let ((f -))
        (declare unsafe)
        (f 'a)))

    (let ()
      (declare safe)
      (let ((v (list + - * /)))
        (declare unsafe)
        ((vector-ref v 1) 'a)))

The following example will raise an exception with any of
Proposals 1, 2, and 3 (assuming for Proposal 1 that the safe
version of - was imported):

    (let ()
      (declare safe)
      (define (f x) (- x))
      (let ()
        (declare unsafe)
        (f 'a)))

The following example will raise an exception with Proposal 1
(assuming the safe version of - was imported), but might not
raise an exception with Proposals 2 or 3:

    (let ()
      (declare unsafe)
      (define (f x) (- x))
      (f 'a))

The following example is a variation of the previous example.
Like the previous example, it will raise an exception with
Proposal 1 (assuming the safe version of - was imported), but
might not raise an exception with Proposals 2 or 3.  The main
interest of this example is that, under Proposal 2, it may be
more likely to raise an exception than the previous example.
(In Will's opinion, this level of detail (e.g. the likelihood
of raising an exception) should certainly be left for
implementors to work out on their own, and should not be
micro-managed by the R6RS editors.)

    (let ()
      (declare unsafe)
      (define (f x) (- x))
      (let ()
        (declare safe)
        (f 'a)))

The following example will raise an exception with Proposal 1
(assuming the safe version of - was imported), but might not
raise an exception with Proposals 2 or 3:

    (let ()
      (declare safe)
      (define (f x) (car x))
      (let ()
        (declare unsafe)
        (- (f (- '(a))))))

The following two examples will raise an exception with
Proposal 3 but might not with Proposal 2, illustrating that
safety is a property of the source code in Proposal 3 and
of the expanded code in Proposal 2.  They will raise an
exception with Proposal 1 if the safe version of car was
imported but might not otherwise.

  (let-syntax ((k (syntax-rules ()
                    ((_ e) (let () (declare unsafe) e)))))
    (let ()
      (declare safe)
      (k (car 'a))))

  (let-syntax ((k (syntax-rules ()
                    ((_) (car 'a)))))
    (let ()
      (declare unsafe)
      (k)))
