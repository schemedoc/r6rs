Appendix: R5RS errors and unspecified effect or values
======================================================


An Error is Signalled
=====================

by SCHEME-REPORT-ENVIRONMENT and by NULL-ENVIRONMENT if
their argument is neither 5 nor another value supported
by the implementation [R5RS 6.5];

by CALL-WITH-INPUT-FILE, CALL-WITH-OUTPUT-FILE,
OPEN-INPUT-FILE, and OPEN-OUTPUT-FILE if the file cannot
be opened [R5RS 6.6.1];

by READ if an end of file is encountered in the middle of
reading an external representation [R5RS 6.6.2].



It is an Error
==============

1.3.2
For example, it is an error for a procedure to be passed an
argument that the procedure is not explicitly specified to
handle, even though such domain errors are seldom mentioned in
this report. Implementations may extend a procedure's domain
of definition to include such arguments.

1.3.3
It is an error for an operation to be presented with an argument
that it is not specified to handle. For succinctness, we follow
the convention that if an argument name is also the name of a
type listed in section 3.2 Disjointness of types, then that
argument must be of the named type. For example, the header
line for vector-ref given above dictates that the first argument
to vector-ref must be a vector. The following naming conventions
also imply type restrictions:

    obj
        any object
    list, list1, ... listj, ...
        list (see section see section 6.3.2 Pairs and lists)
    z, z1, ... zj, ...
        complex number
    x, x1, ... xj, ...
        real number
    y, y1, ... yj, ...
        real number
    q, q1, ... qj, ...
        rational number
    n, n1, ... nj, ...
        integer
    k, k1, ... kj, ...
        exact non-negative integer

3.4
It is an error to attempt to store a new value into a location
that is denoted by an immutable object.

4.1.1
It is an error to reference an unbound variable.

4.1.2
It is an error to alter a constant (i.e. the value of a literal
expression) using a mutation procedure like set-car! or string-set!.

4.1.4 (lambda)
It is an error for a <variable> to appear more than once in
<formals>.

4.2.2 (let)
It is an error for a <variable> to appear more than once in the
list of variables being bound.

4.2.2 (letrec)
It is an error for a <variable> to appear more than once in the
list of variables being bound.

One restriction on `letrec' is very important: it must be
possible to evaluate each <init> without assigning or referring
to the value of any <variable>. If this restriction is violated,
then it is an error. 

4.2.4 (do)
It is an error for a <variable> to appear more than once in the
list of `do' variables. 

4.3.1 (let-syntax)
It is an error for a <keyword> to appear more than once in the
list of keywords being bound.

4.3.2 (pattern language)
It is an error for the same pattern variable to appear more than
once in a <pattern>.

It is an error for `...' to appear in <literals>.
Within a pattern the identifier `...' must follow the last
element of a nonempty sequence of subpatterns.

It is an error to use a macro keyword, within the scope of its
binding, in an expression that does not match any of the
patterns.

It is an error if the output cannot be built up as specified.

5.2.1 (set!)
...whereas it would be an error to perform a `set!' on an
unbound variable. 

5.3 (syntax definitions)
Although macros may expand into definitions and syntax
definitions in any context that permits them, it is an error for
a definition or syntax definition to shadow a syntactic keyword
whose meaning is needed to determine whether some form in the
group of forms that contains the shadowing definition is in fact
a definition, or, for internal definitions, is needed to
determine the boundary between the group and the expressions
that follow the group. For example, the following are errors:

(define define 3)

(begin (define begin list))

(let-syntax
  ((foo (syntax-rules ()
          ((foo (proc args ...) body ...)
           (define proc
             (lambda (args ...)
               body ...))))))
  (let ((x 3))
    (foo (plus x y) (+ x y))
    (define foo x)
    (plus foo x)))

6.1 (equivalence predicates)
Since it is an error to modify constant objects (those returned by
literal expressions), implementations are permitted, though not
required, to share structure between constants where appropriate.
Thus the value of eqv? on constants is sometimes
implementation-dependent.

6.2.3 (implementation restrictions)
The length, vector-length, and string-length procedures must
return an exact integer, and it is an error to use anything but
an exact integer as an index.

6.2.6 (number->string)
It is an error if no possible result makes this expression true.

The error case can occur only when z is not a complex number
or is a complex number with a non-rational real or imaginary part.

6.3.2 (car)
Note that it is an error to take the car of the empty list.

6.3.2 (cdr)
Note that it is an error to take the cdr of the empty list.

6.3.2 (set-car!)
(define (g) '(constant-list))
(set-car! (g) 3)                       ==>  error

6.3.2 (list-tail)
It is an error if list has fewer than k elements.

6.3.2 (list-ref)
It is an error if list has fewer than k elements.

6.3.3 (symbol->string)
It is an error to apply mutation procedures like string-set!
to strings returned by this procedure.

6.3.5 (string-set!)
(define (g) "***")
(string-set! (g) 0 #\?)                ==>  error
(string-set! (symbol->string 'immutable)
             0
             #\?)                      ==>  error

6.3.6 (vector-set!)
(vector-set! '#(0 1 2) 1 "doe")        ==>  error  ; constant vector

6.6.2 (read)
It is an error to read from a closed port.

7.3 (derived expression types)
The following `letrec' macro uses the symbol `<undefined>' in
place of an expression which returns something that when stored
in a location makes it an error to try to obtain the value
stored in the location (no such expression is defined in
Scheme).


Unspecified or Undefined Effect Occurs When
===========================================

zero values are returned to a continuation that was not created
by CALL-WITH-VALUES;

more than one value is returned to a continuation that was not
created by CALL-WITH-VALUES;

zero values, or more than one value, are returned when a delayed
promise is forced;

a captured continuation is used to enter or to exit the dynamic
extent of the before or after computations performed by a call
to DYNAMIC-WIND;

some top-level binding that was not introduced by a definition
is altered via assignment;

some variable bound in a SCHEME-REPORT-ENVIRONMENT is assigned;

a backslash is written within a string that is not followed by
a doublequote or backslash;

the file being opened for output by CALL-WITH-OUTPUT-FILE,
WITH-OUTPUT-TO-FILE, or OPEN-OUTPUT-FILE already exists.


Implementation Restrictions
===========================

1.3.2
This report uses the phrase "may report a violation of an
implementation restriction" to indicate circumstances under
which an implementation is permitted to report that it is unable
to continue execution of a correct program because of some
restriction imposed by the implementation. Implementation
restrictions are of course discouraged, but implementations are
encouraged to report violations of implementation restrictions.

For example, an implementation may report a violation of an
implementation restriction if it does not have enough storage to
run a program. 

6.2.2 (exactness)
Rational operations such as `+' should always produce exact
results when given exact arguments. If the operation is unable
to produce an exact result, then it may either report the
violation of an implementation restriction or it may silently
coerce its result to an inexact value. See section 6.2.3
Implementation restrictions.

6.2.3 (implementation restrictions)
Implementations of Scheme are not required to implement the
whole tower of subtypes given in section 6.2.1 Numerical types,
but they must implement a coherent subset....

Implementations may also support only a limited range of numbers
of any type, subject to the requirements of this section. The
supported range for exact numbers of any type may be different
from the supported range for inexact numbers of that type....

....Furthermore any integer constant within the index
range, if expressed by an exact integer syntax, will indeed be
read as an exact integer, regardless of any implementation
restrictions that may apply outside this range. Finally, the
procedures listed below will always return an exact integer
result provided all their arguments are exact integers and the
mathematically expected result is representable as an exact
integer within the implementation:

+            -             *
quotient     remainder     modulo
max          min           abs
numerator    denominator   gcd
lcm          floor         ceiling
truncate     round         rationalize
expt

Implementations are encouraged, but not required, to support
exact integers and exact rationals of practically unlimited size
and precision, and to implement the above procedures and the `/'
procedure in such a way that they always return exact results
when given exact arguments. If one of these procedures is unable
to deliver an exact result when given exact arguments, then it
may either report a violation of an implementation restriction
or it may silently coerce its result to an inexact number. Such
a coercion may cause an error later.

In particular, implementations that use flonum representations
must follow these rules: A flonum result must be represented
with at least as much precision as is used to express any of the
inexact arguments to that operation. It is desirable (but not
required) for potentially inexact operations such as `sqrt',
when applied to exact arguments, to produce exact answers
whenever possible (for example the square root of an exact 4
ought to be an exact 2). If, however, an exact number is
operated upon so as to produce an inexact result (as by `sqrt'),
and if the result is represented as a flonum, then the most
precise flonum format available must be used; but if the result
is represented in some other way then the representation must
have at least as much precision as the most precise flonum
format available.

Although Scheme allows a variety of written notations for
numbers, any particular implementation may support only some of
them. For example, an implementation in which all numbers are
real need not support the rectangular and polar notations for
complex numbers. If an implementation encounters an exact
numerical constant that it cannot represent as an exact number,
then it may either report a violation of an implementation
restriction or it may silently represent the constant by an
inexact number. 

6.2.5 (max, min)
If `min' or `max' is used to compare numbers of mixed exactness,
and the numerical value of the result cannot be represented as
an inexact number without loss of accuracy, then the procedure
may report a violation of an implementation restriction.

6.2.5 (exact->inexact)
If an exact argument has no reasonably close inexact equivalent,
then a violation of an implementation restriction may be
reported. 

6.2.5 (inexact->exact)
If an inexact argument has no reasonably close exact equivalent,
then a violation of an implementation restriction may be
reported.


Unspecified Values
==================

1.3.2
If the value of an expression is said to be "unspecified," then
the expression must evaluate to some object without signalling
an error, but the value depends on the implementation; this
report explicitly does not say what value should be returned. 

1.3.5
By convention, the names of procedures that store values into
previously allocated locations (see section see section 3.4
Storage model) usually end in "!". Such procedures are called
mutation procedures. By convention, the value returned by a
mutation procedure is unspecified. 

3.5 (tail recursion)
(lambda ()
  (if (g)
      (let ((x (h)))
        x)
      (and (g) (f))))

Note: Implementations are allowed, but not required, to
recognize that some non-tail calls, such as the call to `h'
above, can be evaluated as though they were tail calls. In the
example above, the `let' expression could be compiled as a tail
call to `h'. (The possibility of `h' returning an unexpected
number of values can be ignored, because in that case the effect
of the `let' is explicitly unspecified and
implementation-dependent.) 

4.1.3 (procedure calls)
The operator and operand expressions are evaluated (in an
unspecified order) and the resulting procedure is passed the
resulting arguments.

Note: In contrast to other dialects of Lisp, the order of
evaluation is unspecified, and the operator expression and the
operand expressions are always evaluated with the same
evaluation rules. 

Note: Although the order of evaluation is otherwise unspecified,
the effect of any concurrent evaluation of the operator and
operand expressions is constrained to be consistent with some
sequential order of evaluation. The order of evaluation may be
chosen differently for each procedure call. 

4.1.5 (if)
If <test> yields a false value and no <alternate> is specified,
then the result of the expression is unspecified. 

4.1.6 (set!)
The result of the `set!' expression is unspecified. 

4.2.1 (cond)
If all <test>s evaluate to false values, and there is no else
clause, then the result of the conditional expression is
unspecified;

4.2.1 (case)
If the result of evaluating <key> is different from every
<datum>, then if there is an else clause its expressions are
evaluated and the result(s) of the last is(are) the result(s) of
the `case' expression; otherwise the result of the `case'
expression is unspecified. 

4.2.2 (let)
Semantics: The <init>s are evaluated in the current environment
(in some unspecified order), ...

4.2.2 (letrec)
Semantics: The <variable>s are bound to fresh locations holding
undefined values, the <init>s are evaluated in the resulting
environment (in some unspecified order), ...

4.2.4 (do)
The <init> expressions are evaluated (in some unspecified
order), ...

Each iteration begins by evaluating <test>; if the result is
false (see section see section 6.3.1 Booleans), then the
<command> expressions are evaluated in order for effect, the
<step> expressions are evaluated in some unspecified order, ...

If <test> evaluates to a true value, then the <expression>s are
evaluated from left to right and the value(s) of the last
<expression> is(are) returned. If no <expression>s are present,
then the value of the `do' expression is unspecified. 

6.1 (eqv?)
(eqv? "" "")                           ==>  unspecified
(eqv? '#() '#())                       ==>  unspecified
(eqv? (lambda (x) x)
      (lambda (x) x))                  ==>  unspecified
(eqv? (lambda (x) x)
      (lambda (y) y))                  ==>  unspecified

(define gen-loser
  (lambda ()
    (let ((n 0))
      (lambda () (set! n (+ n 1)) 27))))
(let ((g (gen-loser)))
  (eqv? g g))                          ==>  #t
(eqv? (gen-loser) (gen-loser))         ==>  unspecified

(letrec ((f (lambda () (if (eqv? f g) 'both 'f)))
         (g (lambda () (if (eqv? f g) 'both 'g))))
  (eqv? f g))
                                       ==>  unspecified

Since it is an error to modify constant objects (those returned
by literal expressions), implementations are permitted, though
not required, to share structure between constants where
appropriate. Thus the value of `eqv?' on constants is sometimes
implementation-dependent.

(eqv? '(a) '(a))                       ==>  unspecified
(eqv? "a" "a")                         ==>  unspecified
(eqv? '(b) (cdr '(a b)))               ==>  unspecified

6.1 (eq?)
(eq? '(a) '(a))                        ==>  unspecified
(eq? "a" "a")                          ==>  unspecified
(eq? "" "")                            ==>  unspecified
(eq? 2 2)                              ==>  unspecified
(eq? #\A #\A)                          ==>  unspecified
(let ((n (+ 2 3)))
  (eq? n n))                           ==>  unspecified

6.1 (equal?)
(equal? (lambda (x) x)
        (lambda (y) y))                ==>  unspecified

6.2.6 (number->string)
If z is inexact, the radix is 10, and the above expression can
be satisfied by a result that contains a decimal point, then the
result contains a decimal point and is expressed using the
minimum number of digits (exclusive of exponent and trailing
zeroes) needed to make the above expression true [howtoprint],
[howtoread]; otherwise the format of the result is unspecified.

Rationale: If z is an inexact number represented using flonums,
and the radix is 10, then the above expression is normally
satisfied by a result containing a decimal point. The
unspecified case allows for infinities, NaNs, and non-flonum
representations.

6.3.2 (set-car!)
The value returned by `set-car!' is unspecified.

(define (f) (list 'not-a-constant-list))
(set-car! (f) 3)                       ==>  unspecified

6.3.2 (set-cdr!)
The value returned by `set-cdr!' is unspecified. 

6.3.2 (memq)
(memq 101 '(100 101 102))              ==>  unspecified

6.3.2 (assq)
(assq 5 '((2 3) (5 7) (11 13)))        ==>  unspecified

6.3.5 (strings)
A string constant may continue from one line to the next, but
the exact contents of such a string are unspecified. 

6.3.5 (make-string)
If char is given, then all elements of the string are
initialized to char, otherwise the contents of the string are
unspecified. 

6.3.5 (string-set!)
`String-set!' stores char in element k of string and returns an
unspecified value. 

(define (f) (make-string 3 #\*))
(string-set! (f) 0 #\?)                ==>  unspecified

6.3.5 (string-fill!)
Stores char in every element of the given string and returns an
unspecified value. 

6.3.6 (make-vector)
If a second argument is given, then each element is initialized
to fill. Otherwise the initial contents of each element is
unspecified. 

6.3.6 (vector-set!)
The value returned by `vector-set!' is unspecified.

6.3.6 (vector-fill!)
The value returned by `vector-fill!' is unspecified.

6.4 (map)
The dynamic order in which proc is applied to the elements of
the lists is unspecified. 

6.4 (for-each)
Unlike `map', `for-each' is guaranteed to call proc on the
elements of the lists in order from the first element(s) to the
last, and the value returned by `for-each' is unspecified.

6.4 (force)
(eqv? (delay 1) 1)                ==>  unspecified
(pair? (delay (cons 1 2)))        ==>  unspecified

6.4 (call-with-current-continuation)
The effect of passing no value or more than one value to
continuations that were not created by call-with-values is
unspecified. 

6.6.1 (close-input-port, close-output-port)
The value returned is unspecified.

6.6.3 (write)
`Write' returns an unspecified value.

6.6.3 (display)
`Display' returns an unspecified value.

6.6.3 (newline)
Returns an unspecified value.

6.6.3 (write-char)
...and returns an unspecified value.

6.6.4 (load)
It is unspecified whether the results of the expressions are
printed.  The `load' procedure does not affect the values
returned by `current-input-port' and `current-output-port'.
`Load' returns an unspecified value. 

6.6.4 (transcript-on, transcript-off)
The values returned by these procedures are unspecified.
