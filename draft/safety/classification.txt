Tentative Classification of R6RS Exceptions
===========================================

(FIXME:  This probably should be filed under "exceptions"
rather than "safety", but Mike and I are working together
on this and it was convenient to use the safety directory
that has already been committed.)


Terminology
===========

*  "must raise a ZYX exception" means that, in safe mode,
implementations must detect the situation and raise an
exception with a condition of type ZYX.

*  "should raise a ZYX exception" means that implementations
are encouraged, but not required, to detect the situation
and to raise an exception with a condition of type ZYX.

*  "may raise a ZYX exception" means that implementations
are allowed, but not required or encouraged, to detect
the situation and to raise an exception with a condition
of type ZYX.

*  "might raise a ZYX exception" means that implementations
are allowed, but discouraged, to detect the situation
and to raise an exception with a condition of type ZYX.

*  "returns an unspecified value" means that the value
to be returned is not specified for the situation, but
implementations are not allowed to raise an exception.

The classification above can be abbreviated as
must/should/may/might/returns.

If an implementation is unable to perform an action or
return a value in a way compatible with the R6RS, then
it must raise an &implementation-restriction exception.


Tentative Condition Hierarchy
=============================

&condition
  &message
    &warning
  &serious
    &error
      &implementation-restriction
      &io
      ...
    &violation
      &nonstandard
      &defect
        &lexical
        &syntax
        &domain
          &type
          &list          ; not a proper list
          &alist         ; not a proper list of pairs
          &immutable
        &incompatible    ; arguments okay singly but not together
          &index         ; index out of range
        &result          ; result not well-defined
        &undefined
        ...


The R5RS List Type Should Not Be a Type
=======================================

Revise R5RS 1.3.3 to remove "list, list1, ... listj, ..."
from the list of naming conventions that imply types, and
replace it with "llobjc, llobj1, ... llobjj, ...", which
means a list-like object, i.e. the empty list or a pair.

Revise the procedure entries that require a list as an
argument, and say those procedures take a llobj as
argument instead.  For those procedures that should be
encouraged but not required to raise an exception if one
of their arguments is not a proper list, revise their
description to say they should raise a &list exception.
(All such procedures should appears in the table below.)

I have not yet gotten to the implementation restrictions
or unspecified values.


Issues
======

Exceptions marked by (!!!!!) may be controversial:

4       all expressions                error       must &syntax (!!!!!)
5.2.1   set! (unbound variable)        error       should &undefined (!!!!!)
5.2.1   set! (w/o defining)            unspecified should &undefined (!!!!!)
5.2.1   set! (immutable environment)   unspecified should &immutable (!!!!!)
6.3.2   car of empty list              error       must &type (!!!!!)
6.3.2   cdr of empty list              error       must &type (!!!!!)
6.3.2   length                         error       must &list (!!!!!)
6.3.5   list->string                               must &list (!!!!!)
6.3.6   list->vector                               must &list (!!!!!)
6.4     map, for-each                              must &list (!!!!!)
6.4     map, for-each                              must &incompatible (!!!!!)
6.6.2   read (nonstd external rep)                 must &lexical (!!!!!)

Many implementations support extensions of the R5RS program
syntax, so requiring them to raise a &syntax exception on
illegal syntax will break a lot of non-portable code.

Some programmers would prefer that assignments to unbound
variables or to variables defined in libraries be required
to raise an &undefined exception, and/or that assignments
to variables bound in a scheme-report-environment be
required to raise an &immutable exception.  For some others,
their right to redefine + is inalienable.

Most of the programmers who want car of the empty list to
be defined have gone over to Common Lisp, but requiring
car of the empty list to raise an exception will make it
harder to implement a Scheme-like language on top of Common
Lisp.

Some implementors, and even a few programmers, might object
to requiring the length, list->string, list->vector, map,
and for-each procedures to raise a &list exception when
their argument is a circular list.

Similarly, some programmers might object to requiring the
map and for-each procedures to raise an &incompatible
exception when their lists aren't all the same length.

Many implementations support extensions of the R5RS lexical
syntax, so requiring them to raise a &lexical exception on
illegal lexical syntax will break a lot of non-portable code.

(Implementations could provide a way for programmers to
install implementation-specific exception handlers that
ignore the &lexical exception and continue the program,
but the SRFI 34 exception mechanism is inadequate for
this, and continuable exceptions are likely to be too
slow if constructed on top of the SRFI 34 mechanism.)
