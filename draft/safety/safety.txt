Current Proposal(s) for Safe/Unsafe Mode and Declarations
=========================================================


Goals
=====

We want to make it easier for people to write Scheme
programs and to debug them.

We want to make it easier for people to write portable
programs in Scheme.

We want to tell people that Scheme is buzzword-compatible.


How Safe Mode Contributes to Goals
==================================

Reliable detection of programmed errors ("bugs") makes it
easier to debug and to write programs.

Reliable detection of violations of the language standard
makes it harder for people to write non-portable programs,
whether by accident or on purpose.

Reliable detection of bugs and violations makes it easier
for people to maintain a straight face when claiming that
Scheme is strongly typed.


How Unsafe Mode Contributes to Goals
====================================

Not checking for bugs makes it easier to write Scheme
programs that run fast or interact with unsafe legacy
code.  In some cases, not checking for bugs may be the
best way to accomplish some task using Scheme instead
of using some language that would be much less safe.

Not checking for violations makes it easier for systems
to provide features that are absent from the language
standard, and to experiment with extensions that may
become standard in the future.

Not checking for bugs and violations makes it easier
to claim that Scheme has feature X "in practice", or
that Scheme programs run as fast as programs written
in language Y.


Tentative Design
================

Design of the so-called safe and unsafe modes interacts
strongly with the exception and condition systems, and
to some extent with the library and macro systems.

In what follows, I will assume a hierarchy of condition
types, as in SRFI 35.  For this note, I will assume the
following specific hierarchy of conditions (with tree
structure implied by indentation):

&condition
  &message
    &warning
  &serious
    &error
      &implementation-restriction
      ...
    &violation
      &nonstandard
      &defect
        &lexical
        &syntax
        &domain
        &result
        ...

The R6RS will refer to many condition types not shown above,
but the examples above should give you some idea.

We should extend or revise the R5RS classification of
situations that are relevant to safety or portability.
The word "error" evidently carries some baggage, so we
might want to avoid it.  Here is one possible rephrasing
of the R5RS classification:

*  "must raise a ZYX exception" means that, in safe mode,
implementations must detect the situation and raise an
exception with a condition of type ZYX.

*  "should raise a ZYX exception" means that implementations
are encouraged, but not required, to detect the situation
and to raise an exception with a condition of type ZYX.

*  "may raise a ZYX exception" means that implementations
are allowed, but not required or encouraged, to detect
the situation and to raise an exception with a condition
of type ZYX.

*  "might raise a ZYX exception" means that implementations
are allowed, but discouraged, to detect the situation
and to raise an exception with a condition of type ZYX.

*  "returns an unspecified value" means that the value
to be returned is not specified for the situation, but
implementations are not allowed to raise an exception.

If an implementation is unable to perform an action or
return a value in a way compatible with the R6RS, then
it must raise an &implementation-restriction exception.

We should use some such classification to re-classify
every situation that the R5RS describes as signalling
an error, an error, a violation of an implementation
restriction, having unspecified or undefined effect,
or yielding an unspecified value.  We should also
classify some situations that the R5RS overlooked,
such as syntax errors.

We should specify every situation in which a conforming
implementation of Scheme is required to raise an exception,
and should also identify situations in which a conforming
implementation is allowed to raise an exception.  We should
also specify a condition type for the condition that is to
be raised in each identified situation.  Assuming a design
similar to SRFI 35, implementations would then be free to
use any sub-condition-type of the specified condition, and
to combine them with arbitrarily many other condition
types.

We should insist that the default exception handlers
report certain kinds of exceptions.  Programmers will
be able to override the default handlers using some
mechanism that resembles that of SRFI 34.

The R6RS should also allow implementations to provide ways
for programmers to declare that certain kinds of exceptions
should be handled in implementation-dependent ways.

For example, a programmer might use one of these
implementation-specific declarations to declare that
#3(a b c) should be treated as #(a b c) when read by
the READ procedure.

For another example, a programmer might use one of these
implementation-specific declarations to declare that the
operations exported from a standard fixnum library may
use an exception handler that does not report &domain
conditions.  These nonstandard exception handlers would
be free to handle exceptions in ways that cannot even
be expressed in R6RS Scheme, for example by returning
an incorrect answer or incurring a segmentation fault.

Many of these implementation-specific declarations are
likely to have static rather than dynamic scope.  There
are several ways to explain this, and several proposals
are currently under consideration.  See "Declaration
Semantics" below.

One of the guiding principles of the most recent draft
of the R6RS status report says we will provide some
standard way to declare whether run-time safety checks
are desired.  This can be done by extending the library
mechanism to allow such declarations, and by devising
a syntax for such declarations that has some portable
semantics while leaving room for implementations to
interpret the details as they see fit.

Such declarations could also be allowed to appear at the
head of any body that permits internal definitions.


Declaration Syntax
==================

This section is extremely tentative because of interactions
with library syntax.  For now, let us suppose that the
<body> syntax of SRFI 83 will be changed to

<body> = <impexp-form>* <declaration>* <comdef-form>*

and that the <body> and <definition> syntax of R5RS will
be changed to

<body> --> <declaration>* <definition>* <sequence>
<definition> --> (define <variable> <expression>)
      | (define (<variable> <def formals>) <body>)
      | (begin <declaration>* <definition>*)

The scope of a declaration is the library in which it
appears, the expression that immediately surrounds the
<body> at whose head it appears, or the group of
definitions at whose head it appears.

The current proposal for declaration syntax is

<declaration> --> (declare <declarespec>*)
<declarespec> --> unsafe
                | <quality>
                | (<quality> <priority>)
<quality> --> safe | fast | small | debug
<priority> --> 0 | 1 | 2 | 3

Priority 3 is the highest priority.  Priority 0 means
the quality is not a priority at all.

The unsafe <declarespec> is a synonym for (safe 0).
The safe <declarespec> is a synonym for (safe 3), and
similarly for fast, small, and debug.


Declaration Pragmatics
======================

For safe, the default priority must be 1 or higher.
When the priority for safe is 1 or higher, implementations
must raise all required exceptions and let them be handled
by the usual R6RS exception mechanism.

Beyond that, the detailed interpretation of declarations
will vary in different implementations.  In particular,
implementations are free to ignore declarations, and
may observe some declarations while ignoring others.

(One possible exception to the above is that we may want
to require implementations that implement an unsafe mode
to pay attention to any declarations that increase the
safe priority within an unsafe section of code.)

The following descriptions of each quality may provide
some guidance for programmers and implementors.

safe
====

This quality's priority influences the degree of checking
for exceptional situations, and the raising and handling
of exceptions in response to those situations.  The higher
the priority, the more likely an exception will be raised.

At priority 0, an implementation is allowed to ignore any
R6RS requirements for raising an exception.  In situations
for which the R6RS allows or requires the implementation
to raise an exception, the implementation may ignore the
situation and continue the computation with an incorrect
result, may terminate the computation in an unpleasant
fashion, or may destroy the invariants of run-time data
structures in ways that cause unexpected and mysterious
misbehavior even in code that comes within the scope of
a safe declaration.  All bets are off.

At priority 1 and higher, an implementation must raise all
exceptions required by the R6RS, handle those exceptions
using the exception mechanism described by the R6RS, and
use the default exception handlers described by the R6RS.

At higher priorities, implementations may be more likely
to raise exceptions that are allowed but not required by
the R6RS.

Most implementations are able to recognize some violations
when parsing, expanding macros, or compiling a definition
or expression whose evaluation has not yet commenced in
the usual sense.  Implementations are allowed to use
nonstandard exception handlers at those times, and are
encouraged to raise &lexical and &syntax exceptions for
violations detected at those times, even if the definition
or expression that contains the violation will never be
executed.  Implementations are also allowed to raise a
&warning exception at those times if they determine that
some subexpression would inevitably raise some kind of
&violation exception were it ever to be evaluated.

fast
====

This quality's priority influences the speed of the code
it governs.  At high priorities, the code is likely to
run faster, but that improvement is constrained by other
qualities and may come at the expense of the small and
debug qualities.

small
=====

This quality's priority influences the amount of computer
memory needed to represent and to run the code.  At high
priorities, the code is likely to occupy less memory and
to require less memory during evaluation.

debug
=====

This quality's priority influences the programmer's ability
to debug the code.  At high priorities, the programmer is
more likely to understand the correspondence between the
original source code and information displayed by debugging
tools.  At low priorities, some debugging tools may not be
usable.


Declaration Semantics
=====================

As for the semantics of declarations, at least three
different stories have been proposed.

Will originally proposed that unsafe declarations be
explained as allowing implementations to establish
nonstandard exception handlers that do arbitrarily
perverse things.

Mike found that confusing, and proposed that unsafe
declarations be explained as a relaxation of the R6RS
requirements for raising an exception.

Kent proposed a semantics that explains unsafe mode
(and other declarations) as a property that attaches
to identifiers and is preserved by hygienic macros.


Kent's Proposed Semantics
=========================

To bring the scoping rules for declarations in line with lexical scoping
and referential transparency, and also to limit unnecessary freedom to
ignore safe declarations in some cases where unsafe and safe declarations
are mixed, I would like propose the following treatement of declarations.

 * A declaration appearing in a <body> associates the specified safe,
   fast, small, and debug priorities with each free identifier within the
   <body>, except where the declaration is shadowed by a conflicting
   declaration.

 * If the declare keyword of a declaration is introduced into the output
   of a macro, the declaration affects only the identifiers introduced by
   the macro.  Similarly, an identifier introduced by the macro is
   affected only by such declarations and declarations whose scope
   includes the macro definition.

 * A standard syntactic form (recognized as such because its identifying
   keyword is an identifier reference resolving to a keyword imported from
   the r6rs core language or standard library) whose identifying keyword
   has safe priority 0 has unspecified behavior if a situation for which
   the implementation is allowed or required to raise an exception arises
   directly from the use of the syntactic form.

 * A standard procedure reference (recognized as such because it is an
   identifier reference resolving to a variable binding imported from the
   r6rs core language or standard library) may evaluate to different
   versions of the standard procedure depending on the priorities
   associated with the reference.  In particular, if the standard
   procedure reference is associated with safe priority 0, the standard
   procedure reference may evaluate to an unsafe version of the standard
   procedure.  An unsafe version has unspecified behavior if a situation
   for which the implementation is allowed or required to raise an
   exception arises directly from the use of that standard procedure.

 * Assuming unbound variables are possible in the standard, the behavior
   of an unbound reference to a variable associated with safe priority 0
   is unspecified.

This proposal differs from Will's proposal, as I understand it, in the
following ways:

1. The scope of a declaration is more precisely specified (and possibly
   different from what Will had in mind).

2. It requires that safe code embedded within or run from unsafe code
   must raise all required exceptions, as long as no potentially
   exception-causing situation arises directly from the use of the unsafe
   code.

Also, the notion that exceptions are always raised but are handled in an
unspecified manner in unsafe mode, which Mike, at least, found confusing,
is gone, but I believe that's an expository detail only.

The following illustrates difference 2.  Let's assume that all of the free
identifiers in the code below resolve to the corresponding standard
keyword or procedure bindings.  Let's also assume that the standard
procedure to which + is bound is required to raise a &nonnumeric exception
if any of its arguments are not numbers and that it returns normally
without raising an exception in all other cases.  Then the expression:

  (begin
    (declare unsafe)
    (let ([x (+ 3)])
      (declare safe)
      (+ 'b)))

has unspecified behavior with Will's proposal, even though the outer call
to (possibly unsafe) + returns normally, because the inner safe
declaration can be ignored.  It must raise a &nonnumeric exception with
mine.  Similarly,

  (begin
    (declare unsafe)
    (+ 'a (begin (declare safe) (+ 'b))))

has unspecified behavior with Will's proposal but must raise a &nonnumeric
exception with mine.  The first argument to the outer (possibly unsafe) +
is not a number, but the exception is raised by the inner call to + before
the outer call is made, due to applicative-order evaluation.

In both systems,

  (begin
    (declare unsafe)
    (let ([x (+ 'a)])
      (declare safe)
      (+ 'b)))

has unspecified behavior, because the first (possibly unsafe) + receives a
non-numeric argument, at which point all bets are off.

Note that an implementation is free to ignore all declarations with either
proposal, but with mine it is effectively required not to ignore a safe
declaration that appears within the scope of an unsafe declaration if it
does not also ignore the unsafe declaration.

A likely side implication of my proposal is that eqv? might return either
#t or #f when applied to two versions of a primitive that might differ due
to differing declarations.  For example,

  (eqv? (begin (declare safe) +)
        (begin (declare unsafe) +))

can return either #t or #f.  This doesn't bother me in the slightest,
but we could require that eqv? return #t in situations such as this.
In practice, this would likely cause most implementations to use the
same (default) version of the standard procedure whenever the value
might escape.


Will's Objections to Kent's Proposed Semantics
==============================================

Kent's semantics appears to presuppose a fairly static model of
safe and unsafe code in which every named procedure exists in a
safe version and may also exist in an unsafe version.

Several existing implementations of unsafe code do not conform
to this model.  Furthermore existing implementations of unsafe
code use techniques that appear to be inexpressible and perhaps
even illegal in Kent's model.  In Will's view, this is a
shortcoming of Kent's model, not a shortcoming of existing
implementations.

Consider, for example, the following properties of some
existing implementations of unsafe code:

*  Procedure calls do not check to ensure that the value
being called is a procedure.

*  Procedure calls do not check to ensure that the procedure
being called accepts the number of arguments that are passed.

*  Procedure calls may be unsafe for space complexity in the
sense that they preserve so much more state across the call
than is necessary that they may change the asymptotic space
complexity of the program.  (This is often allowed by R5RS
anyway, and will probably be allowed by the R6RS, but let's
assume an implementation that guarantees the safe-for-space
property in safe code but not in unsafe.)

*  Procedure calls may create infinite loops that cannot be
interrupted and then resumed by the user in the same ways
that the user is accustomed to using in safe code.

Let us suppose that a Scheme programmer wishes to use an
unsafe declaration to allow the four techniques listed above
in the following bit of code, which imports from a library
that the same programmer has written without declarations:

----------------

; my-library exports my-name, my-memq, and my-memq-macro.
; my-name is a string.
; my-memq is like memq except it doesn't detect cyclic lists.
; my-memq-macro is a macro that expands into a call to my-memq.

(import "my-library")

; Must the call to my-name raise an exception?

(define (bug1 x y z)
  (declare unsafe)
  (my-name x y z))

; Must the call to my-memq raise an exception?

(define (bug2 x y z)
  (declare unsafe)
  (my-memq x y z))

; Must the call to my-memq in the macro-expanded code
; raise an exception?

(define (bug3 x y z)
  (declare unsafe)
  (my-memq-macro x y z))

; Should this code execute in constant space?

(define (bug4 x y)
  (declare unsafe)
  (define (loop x y n)
    (if (> n 0)
        (let* ((y2 (vector->list (list->vector y)))
               (y3 (my-memq x y2)))
          (if (not y3)
              (loop x y2 (- n 1)))
          y3)))
  (loop x y (length y)))

; Should this code execute in constant space?

(define (bug5 x y)
  (declare unsafe)
  (define (loop x y n)
    (if (> n 0)
        (let* ((y2 (vector->list (list->vector y)))
               (y3 (my-memq-macro x y2)))
          (if (not y3)
              (loop x y2 (- n 1)))
          y3)))
  (loop x y (length y)))

; Should this code be nicely interruptible?

(define (bug6 x y)
  (declare unsafe)
  (define (loop x y n)
    (if (> n 0)
        (if (not (my-memq x y))
            (loop x y n))
        y))
  (loop x y (length y)))

; Should this code be nicely interruptible?

(define (bug7 x y)
  (declare unsafe)
  (define (loop x y n)
    (if (> n 0)
        (if (not (my-memq-macro x y))
            (loop x y n))
        y))
  (loop x y (length y)))

; Should this code be nicely interruptible?

(define (bug8 x y)
  (declare unsafe)
  (define (loop x y n)
    (if (> n 0)
        (if (not (my-memq x y))
            (loop x y (- n 1)))
        y))
  (set-cdr! y y)
  (loop x y (length y)))

; Should this code be nicely interruptible?

(define (bug9 x y)
  (declare unsafe)
  (define (loop x y n)
    (if (> n 0)
        (if (not (my-memq-macro x y))
            (loop x y (- n 1)))
        y))
  (set-cdr! y y)
  (loop x y (length y)))

----------------

With Will's preferred semantics for the unsafe declaration,
the answer to all nine questions above is "not necessarily".

Let's try to answer those questions using Kent's semantics:

bug1:  The unsafe declaration applies to my-name, but Kent's
semantics does not say anything about the meaning of an
unsafe reference to a string.

bug2:  The unsafe declaration applies to my-memq, but Kent's
semantics does not say anything about unsafe versions of
user-written procedures.

bug3:  The unsafe declaration applies to my-memq-macro, but
does not apply to the reference to my-memq that appears
within the macro-expanded code, so the called procedure is
the safe version of my-memq.  Kent's semantics does not say
whether number-of-argument checking is performed by the
caller or by the callee, however, so it does not say whether
an error must be raised.

bug4:  The unsafe declaration applies to my-memq, but Kent's
semantics does not say whether space complexity is affected
by the safety of the callee as opposed to the caller.

bug5:  The unsafe declaration applies to my-memq-macro, but
does not apply to the reference to my-memq that appears
within the macro-expanded code, so the called procedure is
the safe version of my-memq.  Kent's semantics does not say
whether space complexity is affected by the safety of the
callee as opposed to the caller.

bug6:  The unsafe declaration applies to my-memq, but the
call to my-memq always terminates.  Presumably this code is
not required to be nicely interruptible.

bug7:  The unsafe declaration applies to my-memq-macro, but
does not apply to the reference to my-memq that appears
within the macro-expanded code, so the called procedure is
the safe version of my-memq.  That call always terminates.
Presumably this code is not required to be nicely
interruptible.

bug8:  The unsafe declaration applies to my-memq, and that
procedure goes into an infinite loop on its cyclic argument.
Kent's semantics does not say anything about unsafe versions
of user-written procedures, so it does not say whether the
infinite loop inside my-memq is required to be nicely
interruptible.

bug9:  The unsafe declaration applies to my-memq-macro, but
does not apply to the reference to my-memq that appears
within the macro-expanded code, so the called procedure is
the safe version of my-memq.  Presumably the safe version
of my-memq is required to be nicely interruptible.

The point of these examples is that safety properties are
not always so intuitively associated with identifiers and
with the procedures they name as Kent's semantics appears
to assume.  In Will's view, the additional precision of
Kent's semantics is mostly illusory.  To the extent that
Kent's semantics is more precise on examples such as the
above, it is as likely to be counter-intuitive as to be
intuitive.

Kent's semantics is even less precise and less intuitive
with respect to the fast, small, and debug qualities,
which are mostly heuristic, with no universally agreed
upon meanings in any case.
