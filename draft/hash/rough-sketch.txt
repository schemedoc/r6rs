R6RS Hash Tables (rough sketch)
===============================

In the interests of expedience, many of the descriptions here have been taken or adapted from the descriptions for Larceny, SRFI-69, and MIT Scheme.  Any inconsistencies between descriptions will be corrected in the next draft.


Constructors
------------

Procedure: make-eq-hash-table [initial-capacity] => hash-table 

    Returns a newly allocated hash table that accepts arbitrary objects as keys, and compares those keys with eq?

Procedure: make-eqv-hash-table [initial-capacity] => hash-table

    Returns a newly allocated hash table that accepts arbitrary objects as keys, and compares those keys with eqv?

Procedure: make-hash-table hash-function equivalence-predicate [initial-capacity] => hash-table

    Returns a newly allocated mutable hash table using hash-function as the hash function and equivalence-predicate as the procedure used to compare keys.  The hash-function must accept a key and return a non-negative exact integer. [Larceny]


Basic hash table procedures
---------------------------

Procedure: hash-table? value => boolean

    Returns #t if value was created by one of the hash table constructors.

Procedure: hash-table-size hash-table => integer

    Returns the number of keys contained within the hashtable.

Procedure: hash-table-ref hash-table key => object

    Returns the value associated with key in the hash-table if the hash table contains key; otherwise raises an exception [TODO: hash table exception types].

Procedure: hash-table-get/flag hash-table key flag  => object

    Returns the value associated with key in the hash-table if the hash table contains key; otherwise returns flag.

Procedure: hash-table-get/thunk hash-table key thunk => object

    Returns the value associated with key in the hash-table if the hash table contains key; otherwise tail-calls thunk.

Procedure: hash-table-get hash-table key => object

    Equivalent to (hash-table-get/flag hash-table key #f)

Procedure: hash-table-set! hash-table key value => unspecified

    Changes the hash-table to associate key with value, replacing any existing association for key.

Procedure: hash-table-delete! hash-table key => unspecified

    Removes any association for key within the hash-table.

Procedure: hash-table-contains hash-table

    Returns true iff the hash table contains an entry for key.

Procedure: hash-table-update! hash-table procedure

    Equivalent to: (hash-table-set! hash-table key
                                    (procedure (hash-table-ref hash-table key)))

    Raises an exception if the hash table does not contain an entry for key.

Procedure: hash-table-update!/flag hash-table procedure flag

    Equivalent to, but potentially more efficient than:

    (hash-table-set! hash-table key
                     (procedure (hash-table-get/flag hash-table key flag)))

Procedure: hash-table-update!/thunk hash-table procedure thunk

    Equivalent to, but potentially more efficient than:

    (hash-table-set! hash-table key
                     (procedure (hash-table-get/thunk hash-table key thunk)))

Procedure: hash-table-fold hash-table procedure init => value

    For every association in hash-table, calls procedure with three arguments: the association key, the association value, and an accumulated value. The accumulated value is init for the first invocation of procedure, and for subsequent invocations of procedure, the return value of the previous invocation of procedure. The return value of hash-table-fold is the value of the last invocation of procedure.

Procedure: hash-table-copy hash-table => hashtable

    Returns a copy of hash-table.

Procedure: hash-table-clear! hash-table => unspecified

    Removes all associations from hash-table.  
    Equivalent to: (hash-table-fold hash-table (lambda (k v a) (hash-table-delete! hash-table k)) (if #f #f))

Procedure: hash-table-for-each procedure hash-table => unspecified

    The procedure must accept two arguments, a key and the value associated with that key. The procedure is called once for each key-value association in hash-table. The order of these calls is indeterminate.
    Equivalent to: (hash-table-fold hash-table (lambda (k v a) (procedure k v)) (if #f #f))

Hash functions
--------------

Procedure: eq-hash object => integer

    Returns a hash value for object based on its location.  This procedure is the hash function used by make-eq-hash-table.

Procedure: eqv-hash object => integer

    This procedure is the hash function used by make-eqv-hash-table.

Procedure: equal-hash object => integer

    Returns a hash value for object based on its contents.

Procedure: string-hash string => integer

    Returns a hash value for string based on its content.

Procedure: string-ci-hash string => integer

    Returns a hash value for string based on its content, ignoring case.

Procedure: symbol-hash symbol => integer

    Returns a hash value for symbol based on its print name.


Reflective procedures
---------------------

Procedure: hash-table-equivalence-predicate hash-table => procedure

    Returns the equivalence predicate used by hash-table to compare keys.

Procedure: hash-table-hash-function hash-table => procedure

    Returns the hash function used by hash-table.

Procedure: hash-table-mutable? hash-table => boolean

    Returns mutability status of hash-table.


Derived procedures
------------------

The following potentially useful procedures can easily be implemented in terms of hash-table-fold:

hash-table->alist hash-table = (hash-table-fold hash-table (lambda (k v a) (cons (cons k v) a)) '())
hash-table-keys hash-table   = (hash-table-fold hash-table (lambda (k v a) (cons k a)) '())
hash-table-values hash-table = (hash-table-fold hash-table (lambda (k v a) (cons v a)) '())


Issues, notes & todo items
==========================

Constructors: Eq and eqv hash tables could be constructed simply by providing the eq? or eqv? procedures to the generic constructor make-hash-table, which would obviate the two constructors make-eq-hash-table and make-eqv-hash-table.  It would then be up to the implementation to detect this if necessary, in order to support any required behavior such as rehashing on garbage collection.  However, modifying behavior based on testing the identity of procedures could be considered poor style.  If so, then an approach more like that of MIT Scheme could be used, in which a rehash-after-gc? flag is provided to a hash table constructor-constructor.  The MIT Scheme approach is more general, allowing the programmer to define gc-dependent hash functions.

Limit proposal scope: Should *only* eq and eqv hash tables be specified?

Immutability: The proposal should probably support immutable hash tables, which can be constructed from a provided assoc list.  The appropriate constructor(s) need to be defined, supporting the various hash table options, preferably without doubling the number of constructors.

Complexity: It may be appropriate to specify constraints on complexity, such as: O(1) for retrieval of elements from hash tables; constant time for hash-table-size.

Concurrency: R6RS does not deal with concurrency.  Should this proposal say anything about it?

Omission of procedures: some procedures could perhaps be omitted, e.g. there are four retrieval procedures.  Which one(s) should be omitted, if any?  Procedures which take failure thunks are candidates for omission.

Side-effects in thunks: in some cases, a thunk which mutates the hash table being operated on could cause problems.  May be better to omit any such procedures.

hash-table-map: omitted because a single appropriate specification is not obvious, and any reasonable specification can easily be implemented in terms of hash-table-fold.

Names: should it be hash-table or hashtable?
