This directory contains a reference implementation for sets
of enumerated symbols.  It has not been thoroughly tested,
and the define-enumeration macro is known to have bugs whose
repair would require (r6rs syntax-case), which I have not
yet implemented.

Files:

    enumerations.sch

        The reference implementation.

    larceny.sch

        Auxiliary code for running the reference implementation
        in Larceny.  Load larceny.sch first, then enumerations.sch.

The reference implementation is believed to be written in
R6RS Scheme, but has not been tested in an R6RS-conforming
implementation because no such implementations exist yet.

The reference implementation includes an R5RS macro that won't
work in internal definition contexts, and won't even work at
top level (in some systems) if it is used more than once.  This
macro will have to be rewritten to use (r6rs syntax-case) when
it becomes available.

Only a few non-R5RS features are used.  Most are implemented in
larceny.sch, and Larceny provides the others (filter, symbol-hash)
as extensions.
