This directory contains the textual specification and reference
implementation for sets of enumerated symbols.  Neither has been
thoroughly tested.

Files:

    enumerations.txt

        The textual specification.

    enumerations.sch

        The reference implementation.

    larceny.sch

        Auxiliary code for running the reference implementation
        in Larceny.  Load larceny.sch first, then enumerations.sch.

The reference implementation is written in R5RS Scheme with these
additions:

    a symbol-hash procedure (R6RS hash tables)
    an error procedure (SRFI 23)
    R6RS records (SRFI 76)
    R6RS arithmetic (SRFI 77)

The reference implementation includes an R5RS macro that won't
work in internal definition contexts, and won't even work at
top level (in some systems) if it is used more than once.  This
macro will have to be rewritten to use the R6RS macro system
when it becomes available.

Only a few features of SRFI 76 and SRFI 77 are actually used.
All are implemented in larceny.sch.
