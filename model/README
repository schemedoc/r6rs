This directory contains the PLT Redex implementation of the
R6RS operational semantics and a test suite for the
semantics. It runs in DrScheme v371 (and possibly others as
well).

This version of the semantics matches the r5.92rs report and
the figures in it were automatically generated from
r6rs.scm.

== r6rs.scm: the semantics itself.

== r6rs-tests.scm: the test suite for the semantics. Use:

   mzscheme -mvqt r6rs-tests.scm -e '(run-tests)'

   to run the tests and see a single period shown per test
   run (each test that explores more than 100 states shows a
   colon for each 100 states it explores). To see a more
   verbose output (that shows each test), use:

   mzscheme -mvqt r6rs-tests.scm -e '(run-tests #t)'

== show-examples.scm: use this file to explore particular
   examples in a GUI. Its content shows how to use it and
   gives a few examples. Either run it in DrScheme's module
   language, or like this from the commandline:

   mred -qu show-examples.scm

== test.scm: test suite infrastructure
