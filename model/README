This directory contains the PLT Redex implementation of the
R6RS operational semantics and a test suite for the
semantics. It runs in DrScheme v4.x.

This version of the semantics matches the r5.92rs report.

== r6rs.scm: the semantics itself.

== r6rs-tests.scm: the test suite for the semantics. Use:

   mzscheme -t r6rs-tests.scm -m

   to run the tests and see a single period shown per test
   run (each test that explores more than 100 states shows a
   colon for each 100 states it explores). To see a more
   verbose output (that shows each test), use:

   mzscheme -t r6rs-tests.scm -m #t

== show-examples.scm: use this file to explore particular
   examples in a GUI. Its content shows how to use it and
   gives a few examples. Either run it in DrScheme's module
   language, or like this from the commandline:

   mred show-examples.scm

== test.scm: test suite infrastructure

For details on PLT Redex see:

  http://redex.plt-scheme.org/

Although note that this version of the semantics uses an 
old version of Redex.
