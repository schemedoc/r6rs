   This SRFI is being submitted by members of the Scheme Language
   Editor's Committee as part of the R6RS Scheme standardization
   process.  The purpose of such ``R6RS SRFIs'' is to inform the
   Scheme community of features and design ideas under consideration
   by the editors and to allow the community to give the editors some
   direct feedback that will be considered during the design process.
</p>
<p>
   At the end of the discussion period, this SRFI will be withdrawn.
   When the R6RS specification is finalized, the SRFI may be revised
   to conform to the R6RS specification and then resubmitted with the
   intent to finalize it.  This procedure aims to avoid the situation
   where this SRFI is inconsistent with R6RS.  An inconsistency
   between R6RS and this SRFI could confuse some users.  Moreover it
   could pose implementation problems for R6RS compliant Scheme
   systems that aim to support this SRFI.  Note that departures from
   the SRFI specification by the Scheme Language Editor's Committee
   may occur due to other design constraints, such as design
   consistency with other features that are not under discussion as
   SRFIs.

<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>

Unicode is a widespread universal character code that supports most of
the world's (natural) languages.  The extensions to Scheme specified
in this SRFI concern the support of Unicode in Scheme's character,
string, and symbol datatypes.  This SRFI does not (fully) specify how
I/O of Unicode data is performed or how Scheme source code is encoded
in files; these aspects are left for other SRFIs to specify.

</p>

<h1>Issues</h1>

<ul>

 <li> The extension of symbol syntax does not extend the set of
      symbols to include sensible ASCII combinations, such as
      <code>-&gt;</code>.

 <li> C and many other languages (including some Scheme
      implementations) support octal notation within strings and
      characters. Octal notation is not included in this draft because
      the notation seems no longer as popular as other formats (with
      the notable exception of <code>\0</code>), and the
      variable-width encoding is potentially confusing.

 <li> This draft includes <code>#\linefeed</code> instead of the R5RS
      <code>#\newline</code> character constant.

 <li> Here strings appeared in an earlier draft, but they have been
      removed, perhaps to reappear in future SRFI.

 <li> The <code>\&lt;linefeed&gt;&lt;intraline-whitespace&gt;</code> may not be necessary.
      Meanwhile, unescaped newlines perhaps should be prohibited in strings.

 <li> The current draft provides no locale-specific operations on
      strings. Probably it belongs in another standard, but a few
      placeholders might be useful here.

 <li> The <code>string-titlecase</code> procedure is not the same as
      Unicode's titlecase conversion for strings, because Unicode
      defines a more elaborate word-breaking algorithm. More
      generally, it's not clear that titlecase operations are useful
      enough to include in the standard.

</ul>

<h1>Revision History</h1>

<ul>

 <li> Second draft:
 <ul>

   <li> Removed here strings.
 
   <li> Added <code>char-foldcase</code> and <code>string-foldcase</code>
        and redefined the case-insensitive operations in terms of these.

   <li> Added <code>string-upcase</code>, <code>string-downcase</code>,
        and <code>string-titlecase</code>.

   <li> Changed the definition of <code>char-lower-case?</code> and
   <code>char-upper-case?</code> to better match Unicode instead of SRFI-14.

   <li> Removed <code>char-symbolic?</code>,
   <code>char-punctuation?</code>, <code>char-graphic?</code>,
   <code>char-blank?</code>, and <code>char-iso-control?</code>.

   <li> Removed <code>\'</code> and <code>\?</code> string/symbol escapes.

   <li> Added examples for character and string operations.

   <li> Expanded rationale.
 </ul>

 <li> Third draft:
 <ul>

   <li> Removed <code>#\newline</code>.
 
   <li> Changed the escape sequence for hexadecimal-specified
        characters in strings, characters, and symbols to use
        <code>#\x&lt;x&gt;...&lt;x&gt;</code>. In
        strings and symbols, the escape sequence is terminated by a
        semi-colon.

   <li> Changed the set of characters allowed in a symbol to exclude
        paired punctuation and format controls.

   <li> Added <code>char-general-category</code>,
        <code>string-normalize-nfd</code>, <code>string-normalize-nfkd</code>,
        <code>string-normalize-nfc</code>, and <code>string-normalize-nfkc</code>.

   <li> Added a note in the rationale about a possible implementation
        restriction to ASCII.
 </ul>

</ul>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>

The manipulation of text is a fundamental information processing task,
and software increasingly must process text in a variety of natural
languages, possibly multiple languages in the same document.  The
Unicode standard specifies how the textual data of most of the world's
languages is represented and handled.  Several operating systems,
programming languages, libraries, and software tools have now embraced
the Unicode standard.  Adding Unicode support to Scheme, as specified
by this SRFI, will allow</p>

<ul>
  <li> multilingual text processing;
  <li> internationalization (adaptation of software to the
       linguistic preference of its users);
  <li> improved interoperability with operating systems, programming
       languages, libraries, and software tools that support Unicode; and
  <li> improved portability of programs between R6RS Scheme
       implementations.
</ul>

<p>The SRFI mandates a specific set of values for characters, a
specific definition of strings in terms of characterm, and a specific
definitiond of operations like <code>char&lt;?</code> and
<code>string-ci=?</code> in terms of those characters and strings. The
goal of such mandates is to dramatically increase portability of
Scheme programs through to well understand (if imperfect) concepts and
definitions.</p>

<p>For some implementations of Scheme, such as those that are targeted
to small devices, the mandates of this SRFI ask too much.  For other
implementations of Scheme, such as those that can support a more
sophisticated definition of "character", this SRFI interferes by
requiring specifically less. In the long run, a module system for
Scheme should support a considerably broader range of conformant
implementations, allowing implementations to support certain modules
and not support others. The purpose of this SRFI, however, is to
establish a baseline from which we can define simplifications for
"smaller" Scheme and elaborations for "larger" Schemes.</p>

<p>Although this SRFI requires every Unicode scalar value to have a
corresponding character, a implementation limited to ASCII characters
might reasonably call itself "restricted to ASCII, but otherwise
conformant to the SRFI." Such an implementation would signal an error
when <code>integer->char</code> is used with a value larger than 127,
or when a <code>\x</code> escape specifies a scalar value larger than
127. In addition, the implementation would only accept programs that
are expressed with ASCII characters. Despite these limitations, the
operations specified by the SRFI are closed with respect to ASCII, so
an ASCII-limited implementation is relatively easy to specify, and its
behavior would be relatively predictable to programmers and users. The
operations are similarly closed over Uniocde scalar values below
#x10000 (i.e., those that fit into 16 bits). In contrast, an
implementation intended to support a Latin-1 subset of Unicode will be
less easily specified, since operations such as normalization and
case-folding are not closed with respect to Latin-1.</p>

<h2>Unicode Background</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode</a>
defines a standard mapping between sequences of <strong>code
points</strong> (integers in the range 0 to #x10FFFF in the latest
version of the standard) and human-readable ``characters.'' More
precisely, Unicode distinguishes between <strong>glyphs</strong>,
which are printed for humans to read, and <strong>characters</strong>,
which are abstract entities that map to glyphs (sometimes in a way
that's sensitive to surrounding characters). Furthermore, different
sequences of code points sometimes correspond to the same
character. The relationships among code points, characters, and glyphs
are subtle and complex.
</p>

<p>
Despite this complexity, most things that a literate human would call
a ``character'' can be represented by a single code point in Unicode
(though there may exist code-point sequences that represent that same
character). For example, Roman letters, Cyrillic letters, Hebrew
consonants, and most Chinese characters fall into this category. Thus,
the ``code point'' approximation of ``character'' works well for many
purposes. It is thus appropriate to define Scheme characters as Unicode
<strong>scalar values</strong>, which includes all code points except
those designated as <strong>surrogates</strong>.  A surrogate is a code
point in the range #xD800 to #xDFFF that is used in pairs in the UTF-16
encoding to encode a <strong>supplementary character</strong> (whose
code is in the range #x10000 to #x10FFFF).
</p>

<h2>String and Symbol Literals</h2>

<p>
Many programming languages use a lexical syntax for strings that is
similar to the one used by the C language.  In particular, Java has
extended C's notation for Unicode.  Adopting a similar syntax for
Scheme has the advantage of making it easier to learn and remember,
particularly by programmers accustomed to other languages.
</p>

<p> R5RS specifies that the escape sequences <code>\\</code> and
<code>&quot;</code> can be used in string literals to denote the backslash
and doublequote characters respectively.  This SRFI introduces new
escape sequences so that any Scheme string can be expressed using the
ASCII subset of Unicode. Also, most C string literals have the same
meaning as a Scheme string literal.</p>

<p>This SRFI also extends the lexical syntax of symbols, and it puts
symbols in one-to-one correspondence with immutable strings. In the
revised lexical syntax, most Unicode characters can be used directly
as symbol characters. Furthermore, an escape sequence in
symbols supports arbitrary characters in a symbol
literal.</p>

<h2>Locales</h2>

<p>Besides printing and reading characters, humans also compare
character strings, and humans perform operations such as changing
characters to uppercase. To make programs geographically portable,
humans must agree to compare or upcase characters consistently, at
least in certain contexts. The Unicode standard provides such standard
case mappings on scalar values.</p>

<p>In other contexts, global agreement is unnecessary, and the user's
culture should determine a string operation, such as when sorting a
list of file names, perhaps case-insensitively. A locale captures
information about a user's culture-specific interpretation of
character sequences. In particular, a locale determines how strings
are sorted, how a lowercase character is converted to an uppercase
character, and how strings are compared without regard to case.</p>

<p>String operations such as <code>string-ci=?</code> are <b>not</b>
sensitive to the current locale, because they should be portable. A
future SRFI might define operations like
<code>string-locale-ci=?</code> to produce results that are consistent
with the current locale as determined by an implementation.</p>

<h2>Not Addressed in this SRFI</h2>

This SRFI does not address locales, and it does not address encoding
issues, such as how a sequence of bytes in a file is to be decoded
into a sequence of characters, or how a filesystem path is encoded as
a string.

<h1>Specification</h1>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------- -->

<h2>Types</h2>

This SRFI extends or re-defines the standard types <b>character</b>, <b>string</b>,
and <b>symbol</b>.

<h3>Character Type</h3>

<p> The Scheme character type corresponds to the set of Unicode scalar
values.  Specifically, each character corresponds to a number in the
range [0, #xD7FF] union [#xE000, #x10FFFF], and properties of the
character are as defined for the corresponding Unicode scalar value.</p>

<p> The <code>integer-&gt;char</code> procedure takes a Unicode scalar
value as an exact integer, and it produces the corresponding
character. The <code>char-&gt;integer</code> procedure takes a
character and produces the corresponding scalar value. It is an error
to call <code>integer-&gt;char</code> with an integer that is not in
the range [0, #xD7FF] union [#xE000, #x10FFFF].</p>

<p>Examples:
<pre>
      (integer-&gt;char 32) =&gt; #\space
      (char-&gt;integer (integer-&gt;char 5000)) =&gt; 5000
      (integer-&gt;char #xD800) =&gt; <i>error</i>
</pre>
</p>

<h3>String Type</h3>

<p> Like in R5RS, a Scheme string is a sequence of Scheme characters.
The procedure call <code>(string-ref <i>str</i> <i>i</i>)</code>
returns the Scheme character at index <code><i>i</i></code> in the
string <code><i>str</code></i>.  The procedure call <code>(string-set!
<i>str</i> <i>i</i> <i>char</i>)</code> stores the Scheme character
<code><i>char</i></code> at index <code><i>i</i></code> in the string
<code><i>str</i></code>, and an unspecified value is returned.  </p>

<h3>Symbol Type</h3>

<p> A symbol is defined by a sequence of characters. The
<code>string-&gt;symbol</code> procedure works on any string, and
<code>symbol-&gt;string</code> works on any symbol.  </p>


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------- -->

<h2>Lexical Syntax</h2>

The syntax of Scheme is defined in terms of characters, not bytes, and
remains largely unchanged with the refined definition of character.
This SRFI defines and extends only the lexical syntax of characters,
strings, and symbols.

<h3>Character Lexical Syntax</h3>

<p>
R5RS specifies two lexical syntaxes for characters: named characters,
e.g. <code>#\space</code>, and plain characters, e.g. <code>#\[</code>.
For consistency with the escape sequences of strings and symbols, the
following set of named characters is defined by this SRFI:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> <code>#\nul</code> : Unicode 0
  <li> <code>#\alarm</code> : Unicode 7
  <li> <code>#\backspace</code> : Unicode 8
  <li> <code>#\tab</code> : Unicode 9
  <li> <code>#\linefeed</code> : Unicode 10
  <li> <code>#\vtab</code> : Unicode 11
  <li> <code>#\page</code> : Unicode 12
  <li> <code>#\return</code> : Unicode 13
  <li> <code>#\esc</code> : Unicode 27
  <li> <code>#\space</code> : Unicode 32 (as in R5RS)
  <li> <code>#\delete</code> : Unicode 127
</ul>

<p>
To allow denoting any Unicode character using the ASCII subset of
Unicode, this SRFI specifies the following escape syntax:
</p>

<ul>

  <li> <code>#\x&lt;x&gt;...&lt;x&gt;</code> : where each
       <code>&lt;x&gt;</code> is a hexadecimal digit,
       at least one and no more than eight <code>&lt;x&gt;</code>s are provided, and the sequence of 
       <code>&lt;x&gt;</code>s forms a hexadecimal number between 0 and #x10FFFF 
       excluding the range [#xD800, #xDFFF].
</ul>

<p>
All character syntaxes are case-sensitive, except that
<code>&lt;x&gt;</code> can be an uppercase or lowercase hexadecimal
digit. Unlike R5RS, every character datum must be followed by a
delimiter (which is why no specific terminator is needed after the last
<code>&lt;x&gt;</code> in <code>#\x&lt;x&gt;...&lt;x&gt;</code>). </p>

<p>Examples:
<pre>
  #\xFF        ; Unicode 255
  #\x03BB      ; Unicode 955
  #\x00006587  ; Unicode 25991
  #\&#955;          ; Unicode 955

  #\x0001z     ; <i>parse error</i>
  #\&#955;x         ; <i>parse error</i>
  #\alarmx     ; <i>parse error</i>
  #\alarm x    ; Unicode 7 followed by x
  #\Alarm      ; <i>parse error</i>
  #\alert      ; <i>parse error</i>
  #\xA         ; Unicode 10
  #\xFF        ; Unicode 255
  #\xff        ; Unicode 255
  #\x ff       ; Unicode 120 followed by another datum, ff
  #\x(ff)      ; Unicode 120 followed by another datum, a parenthesized ff
  #\(x)        ; <i>parse error</i>
  #\(x         ; <i>parse error</i>
  #\((x)       ; Unicode 40 followed by another datum, parenthesized x
  #\x00110000  ; <i>parse error (out of range)</i>
  #\x000000001 ; <i>parse error (too many digits)</i>
  #\xD800      ; <i>parse error (in excluded range)</i>
</pre>

<h3>String Lexical Syntax</h3>

<p>As in R5RS, a string datum is enclosed between double quotes ("),
 where a backslash adjusts the meaning of a character within the
 double quotes. The set of escape sequences is as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> <code>\a</code> : alarm, Unicode 7
  <li> <code>\b</code> : backspace, Unicode 8
  <li> <code>\t</code> : tab, Unicode 9
  <li> <code>\n</code> : linefeed, Unicode 10
  <li> <code>\v</code> : vertical tab, Unicode 11
  <li> <code>\f</code> : formfeed, Unicode 12
  <li> <code>\r</code> : return, Unicode 13
  <li> <code>\&quot;</code> : doublequote, Unicode 34
  <li> <code>\\</code> : backslash, Unicode 92
  <li> <code>\&lt;linefeed&gt;&lt;intraline-whitespace&gt;</code> : nothing,
       where <code>&lt;linefeed&gt;</code> is Unicode 10,
       and <code>&lt;intraline-whitespace&gt;</code> is a sequence of non-linefeed whitespace characters
       (where whitespace is defined in <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-14/">SRFI-14</a>)
  <li> <code>\&lt;space&gt;</code> : space, Unicode 32, where <code>&lt;space&gt;</code> is the character Unicode 32 (useful for
       terminating the previous escape sequence before continuing with whitespace)
  <li> <code>\x&lt;x&gt;...&lt;x&gt;;</code> : (note the terminating semi-colon) 
       where each <code>&lt;x&gt;</code> is a hexadecimal digit,
       at least one and no more than eight <code>&lt;x&gt;</code>s are provided,
       and the sequence of <code>&lt;x&gt;</code>s forms a hexadecimal number between 0 and 
       #xFFFF excluding the range [#xD800, #xDFFF]
</ul>

<p>These escape sequences are case-sensitive, except that
<code>&lt;x&gt;</code> can be an uppercase or lowercase hexadecimal
digit. </p>


<p>
Any other character in a string after a backslash is an error.  Any
character outside of an escape sequence and not a doublequote stands
for itself in the string literal.  For example the single-character string
 <code>"&lambda;"</code> (double quote, a lowercase lambda,
double quote) denotes the same string literal as
<code>"\x03bb;"</code>.
</p>

<p>Examples:
<pre>
 "abc"          ; Unicode sequence 97, 98, 99
 "\x41;bc"      ; "Abc", which is Unicode sequence 65, 98, 99
 "\x41; bc"     ; "A bc", which is Unicode sequence 65, 32, 98, 99
 "\x41bc;"      ; Unicode sequence 16828
 "\x41"         ; <i>parse error</i>
 "\x;"          ; <i>parse error</i>
 "\x41bx;"      ; <i>parse error</i>
 "\x00000041;"  ; "A", which is Unicode sequence 65
 "\x0010FFFF;"  ; Unicode sequence #x10FFFF
 "\x00110000;"  ; <i>parse error (out of range)</i>
 "\x000000001;" ; <i>parse error (too many digits)</i>
 "\xD800;"      ; <i>parse error (in excluded range)</i>
</pre>


<h3><a name="symbols">Symbol Lexical Syntax</a></h3>

<p>The syntax of symbols extends R5RS in three ways:
<ul>

 <li> Symbols are case-sensitive.

 <li> Where R5RS allows a <code>&lt;letter&gt;</code>, this SRFI
      allows in addition any character whose scalar value is greater
      than 127 and whose Unicode general category is Lu, Ll, Lt, Lm, Lo,
      Mn, Mc, Me, Nd, Nl, No, Pd, Pc, Po, Sc, Sm, Sk, So, or Co (i.e.,
      not Ps, Pe, Pi, Pf, Zs, Zp, Zl, Cc, or Cf, which is paired
      punctuation, whitespace, a control, or a format). The following is
      a complete list of excluded characters above scalar value 127 in
      Unicode 4.1:

 <li> When a backslash appears in a symbol, it must start with a
      <code>\x&lt;x&gt;...&lt;x&gt;;</code> escape, which identifies
      an arbitrary character to include in the symbol. Note that a
      backslash itself can be specified as <code>\x5C;</code>.

</ul>

<p>Examples:
</p>

<pre>
 'Hello =&gt; Hello
 'H\x65;llo =&gt; Hello
 '&lambda; =&gt; &lambda;
 '\x3BB; =&gt; &lambda;
 (string-&gt;symbol "a b") =&gt; a\x20;b
 (string-&gt;symbol "a\\b") =&gt; a\x5C;b
 'a\x20;b =&gt; a\x20;b
 '|a b| ; <i>parse error (illegal character vertical bar)</i>
 'a\nb  ; <i>parse error (illegal use of backslash)</i>
 'a\x20 ; <i>parse error (missing semi-colon to terminate \x escape)</i>
</pre>

<h2>Procedures</h2>

This SRFI defines and extends procedures for characters and strings.
 Programmers should recognize that these procedures may not produce
 results that an end-user would consider sensible with a particular
 locale. This SRFI defines no locale-sensitive operations.

<h3>Character Procedures</h3>

<p>Character-comparison procedures are defined as follows:
<pre>
   ;; char-comparator itself is not part of this SRFI; it is
   ;; used only to define other procedures
   (define (char-comparator num-comp)
     (lambda (a-char b-char)
       (num-comp (char-&gt;integer a-char) (char-&gt;integer b-char))))

   (define char=? (char-comparator =))
   (define char&lt;? (char-comparator &lt;))
   (define char&gt;? (char-comparator &gt;))
   (define char&lt;=? (char-comparator &lt;=))
   (define char&gt;=? (char-comparator &gt;=))
</pre>

<p>Unicode defines locale-independent mappings from scalar values to
scalar values for upcase, downcase, titlecase, and case-folding operations. (These
mappings can be extracted from <a
href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt">UnicodeData.txt</a>
and <a
href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/CaseFolding.txt">CaseFolding.txt</a>
from the Unicode Consortium, ignoring Turkic mappings in the latter.) The following Scheme procedures map
characters consistent with the Unicode specification:
</p>

<ul> 
<li> <code>char-upcase</code>
<li> <code>char-downcase</code>
<li> <code>char-titlecase</code>
<li> <code>char-foldcase</code>
</ul>

These procedures take a character argument and return a character
result.  If the argument is an uppercase or titlecase character, and
if there is a single character which is its lowercase form, then
<code>char-downcase</code> returns that character.  If the argument is
a lowercase or titlecase character, and if there is a single character
which is its uppercase form, then <code>char-upcase</code> returns
that character. If the argument is a lowercase or uppercase character,
and if there is a single character which is its titlecase form,
then <code>char-titlecase</code> returns that character. Finally, if
the character has a case-folded character, <code>char-foldcase</code>
returns that character. Otherwise, the character returned is the same
as the argument. For Turkic characters &#x130; (#\x130) and &#x131;
(#\x131), <code>char-foldcase</code> behaves as the identity function,
otherwise it is the same as <code>char-downcase</code> composed
with <code>char-upcase</code>. Note that these character-based
operations are an incomplete approximation to case conversion, even
ignoring the user's locale; in general, case mappings require the
context of a string, both in arguments and in result.  See
<code>string-upcase</code>, <code>string-downcase</code>,
<code>string-titlecase</code>, and <code>string-foldcase</code> for
more general case-conversion procedures.

<p>Case-insensitive character-comparison procedures are defined as
follows:
<pre>
   ;; char-ci-comparator itself is not part of this SRFI; it is
   ;; used only to define other procedures
   (define (char-ci-comparator cs-comp)
     (lambda (a-char b-char)
       (cs-comp (char-foldcase a-char) (char-foldcase b-char))))

   (define char-ci=? (char-ci-comparator char=?))
   (define char-ci&lt;? (char-ci-comparator char&lt;?))
   (define char-ci&gt;? (char-ci-comparator char&gt;?))
   (define char-ci&lt;=? (char-ci-comparator char&lt;=?))
   (define char-ci&gt;=? (char-ci-comparator char&gt;=?))
</pre>

<p>The following procedure takes a character and returns a symbol
representing its Unicode general category, one of
<code>'lu</code>,
<code>'ll</code>,
<code>'lt</code>,
<code>'lm</code>,
<code>'lo</code>,
<code>'mn</code>,
<code>'mc</code>,
<code>'me</code>,
<code>'nd</code>,
<code>'nl</code>,
<code>'no</code>,
<code>'ps</code>,
<code>'pe</code>,
<code>'pi</code>,
<code>'pf</code>,
<code>'pd</code>,
<code>'pc</code>,
<code>'po</code>,
<code>'sc</code>,
<code>'sm</code>,
<code>'sk</code>,
<code>'so</code>,
<code>'zs</code>,
<code>'zp</code>,
<code>'zl</code>,
<code>'cc</code>,
<code>'cf</code>,
<code>'cs</code>,
<code>'co</code>, or
<code>'cn</code>:
<ul>
 <li> <code>char-general-category</code>
</ul>

<p>Among the following predicates, the first three are as defined by
 <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-14/">SRFI-14</a>; the last
 three are defined as scalar values having the Unicode "Uppercase"
 property, the "Lowercase" property, and the "Lt" general category,
 respectively.
</p>

<ul> 
 <li> <code>char-alphabetic?</code> 
 <li> <code>char-numeric?</code>
 <li> <code>char-whitespace?</code>
 <li> <code>char-upper-case?</code>
 <li> <code>char-lower-case?</code> <li> 
 <code>char-title-case?</code>
 </ul>

<p>Examples:</p>
<pre>
  (char&lt;? #\z #\&#xDF;) =&gt; #t
  (char&lt;? #\z #\Z) =&gt; #f
  (char-ci&lt;? #\z #\Z) =&gt; #f
  (char-ci=? #\z #\Z) =&gt; #t

</pre>


<h3>String Procedures</h3>

<p>The following string procedures are defined as in R5RS, which means
that they are defined by pointwise operation on the string's
characters:</p>
<ul>
 <li> <code>string&lt;?</code>
 <li> <code>string&gt;?</code>
 <li> <code>string=?</code>
 <li> <code>string&lt;=?</code>
 <li> <code>string&gt;=?</code>
</ul>

<p>The following string operations are <i>not</i> defined in terms of
character-by-character conversions. Instead, they are defined as in
terms of Unicode's locale-independent string mappings from
scalar-value sequences to scalar-value sequences. (These mappings can be
extracted from <a
href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt">UnicodeData.txt</a>,
<a
href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/SpecialCasing.txt">SpecialCasing.txt</a>,
<a
href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/CaseFolding.txt">CaseFolding.txt</a> without Turkic mappings,
and 
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/CompositionExclusions.txt">CompositionExclusions.txt</a>
from the Unicode Consortium.) In particular, the length of the result
string can be different than the length of the input string:
<ul>
 <li> <code>string-upcase</code>
 <li> <code>string-downcase</code>
 <li> <code>string-titlecase</code>
 <li> <code>string-foldcase</code>
 <li> <code>string-normalize-nfd</code>
 <li> <code>string-normalize-nfkd</code>
 <li> <code>string-normalize-nfc</code>
 <li> <code>string-normalize-nfkc</code>
</ul>

<p>
These procedures take a string argument argument and return a string
result.  The <code>string-upcase</code> procedure converts a string to
uppercase, <code>string-downcase</code> converts a string to
lowercase, and <code>string-foldcase</code> converts each character in
the string to its case-folded representative(s). The
<code>string-titlecase</code> procedure converts the first character
to titlecase in each contiguous sequence of cased characters within
string, and it downcases all other cased characters; for the
purposes of detecting cased-character sequences, case-ignorable
characters are ignored (i.e., they do not interrupt the
sequence). Since each of these procedures is locale-independent, they
still are suboptimal for some locales, but this SRFI defines no
locale-sensitive operations.</p>

The <code>string-normalize-nfd</code>,
 <code>string-normalize-nfkd</code>,
 <code>string-normalize-nfc</code>, and
 <code>string-normalize-nfkc</code> procedures each return a string
 that is the input string normalized to Unicode form D, KD, C, or KC,
 respectively.

<p>Case-insensitive string-comparison procedures are defined as
follows:</p>
<pre>
   ;; string-ci-comparator itself is not part of this SRFI; it is
   ;; used only to define other procedures
   (define (string-ci-comparator cs-comp)
     (lambda (a-string b-string)
       (cs-comp (string-foldcase a-string) (string-foldcase b-string))))

   (define string-ci=? (string-ci-comparator string=?))
   (define string-ci&lt;? (string-ci-comparator string&lt;?))
   (define string-ci&gt;? (string-ci-comparator string&gt;?))
   (define string-ci&lt;=? (string-ci-comparator string&lt;=?))
   (define string-ci&gt;=? (string-ci-comparator string&gt;=?))
</pre>

<p>Examples:
<pre>
  (string&lt;? "z" "&#xDF") =&gt; #t
  (string&lt;? "z" "zz") =&gt; #t
  (string&lt;? "z" "Z") =&gt; #f
  (string=? "Stra&#xDF;e" "Strasse") =&gt; #f

  (string-upcase "Hi") =&gt; "HI"
  (string-downcase "Hi") =&gt; "hi"
  (string-foldcase "Hi") =&gt; "hi"

  (string-upcase "Stra&#xDF;e") =&gt; "STRASSE"
  (string-downcase "Stra&#xDF;e") =&gt; "stra&#xDF;e"
  (string-foldcase "Stra&#xDF;e") =&gt; "strasse"
  (string-downcase "STRASSE")  =&gt; "strasse"

  (string-upcase "&#x03A7;&#x0391;&#x039F;&#x03A3;") =&gt; "&#x03A7;&#x0391;&#x039F;&#x03A3;"

<h1>Reference Implementation</h1>

<p> MzScheme version 301.12 and up implements the character and
string operations described in this SRFI. A portable implementation
using R5RS Scheme (to implement a distinct character type) will
accompany a future draft of this SRFI.</p>

<p> The file <a href="r6rs-reader.ss">r6rs-reader.ss</a> implements a
MzScheme-specific reader for the character, string, and symbol syntax
described in this SRFI (without changing any other aspect of MzScheme's
read-level syntax). This reader uses readtable support from MzScheme
301.12 and up. The file <a href="r6rs-reader-test.ss">r6rs-reader-test.ss</a>
contains a test suite.
