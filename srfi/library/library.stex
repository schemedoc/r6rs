\sectionstar{Status}

This SRFI is being submitted by a member of the Scheme Language Editor's
Committee as part of the {\r6rs} Scheme standardization process.  The purpose
of such ``{\r6rs} SRFIs'' is to inform the Scheme community of features and
design ideas under consideration by the editors and to allow the community
to give the editors some direct feedback that will be considered during
the design process.

At the end of the discussion period, this SRFI will be withdrawn.  When
the {\r6rs} specification is finalized, the SRFI may be revised to conform to
the {\r6rs} specification and then resubmitted with the intent to finalize
it.  This procedure aims to avoid the situation where this SRFI is
inconsistent with {\r6rs}.  An inconsistency between {\r6rs} and this SRFI could
confuse some users.  Moreover it could pose implementation problems for
{\r6rs} compliant Scheme systems that aim to support this SRFI.  Note that
departures from the SRFI specification by the Scheme Language Editor's
Committee may occur due to other design constraints, such as design
consistency with other features that are not under discussion as SRFIs.

\section{Abstract}

The library system presented here is designed to let programmers share
libraries, i.e., code that is intended to be incorporated into larger
programs, and especially into programs that use library code from multiple
sources.  The library system supports macro definitions within libraries,
allows macro exports, and distinguishes the phases in which definitions
and imports are needed.  This SRFI defines a standard notation for
libraries, a semantics for library expansion and execution, and a simple
format for sharing libraries.

\section{Rationale\label{sec:rationale}}

This standard addresses the following specific goals:

\begin{itemize}
\item Separate compilation and analysis; no two libraries have to be compiled at the same time (i.e., the meanings of two libraries cannot depend on each other cyclically, and compilation of two different libraries cannot rely on state shared across compilations), and significant program analysis does not require a whole program.
\item Independent compilation/analysis of unrelated libraries, where ``unrelated'' means that neither depends on the other through a transitive closure of imports.
\item Explicit declaration of dependencies, so that the meaning of each identifier is clear at compile time, and so that there is no ambiguity about whether a library needs to be executed for another library's compile time and/or run time.
\item Namespace management, so that different library producers are unlikely to define the same top-level name. 
\end{itemize}

It does not address the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Mutually dependent libraries.
\item Separation of library interface from library implementation.
\item Code outside of a library (e.g., 5 by itself as a program).
\item Local modules and local imports. 
\end{itemize}


\section{Specification\label{sec:specification}}

\subsection{Library form}

A library declaration contains the following elements:

\begin{itemize}
\item a name for the library (possibly compound, with versioning),
\item a list of import dependencies, where each dependency specifies the
      following:
\begin{itemize}
\item the imported library's name,
\item the relevant phases, e.g., expand or run time, and
\item the subset of the library's exports to make available within the
      importing library, and the local names to use within the importing
      library for each of the library's exports,
\end{itemize}
\item a list of exports, which name a subset of the library's imports and
      definitions, and
\item a library body, consisting of a sequence of definitions followed
      by a sequence of expressions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Syntax and Semantics}

A library definition is written with the library form:

\schemedisplay
(library \raw{\ang{library~name}}
  (import \raw{\ang{import~spec}}\raw{\kstar})
  (export \raw{\ang{export~spec}}\raw{\kstar})
  \raw{\ang{library~body}})
\endschemedisplay

The \ang{library~name} specifies the name of the library, the
\scheme{import} form specifies the imported bindings, and the
\scheme{export} form specifies the exported bindings.
The \ang{library~body} specifies the set of definitions, both for local
(unexported) and exported bindings, and the set of initialization
expressions (commands) to be evaluated for their effects.
The exported bindings may be defined within the library or imported into
the library.
Bindings defined with a library are not visible in code that appears
outside of the library unless they are explicitly exported from the
library. 

An identifier can be imported from multiple libraries only if the
binding exported by each library is the same (i.e., the binding is
defined in one library, and it arrives throgh the imports only by
exporting and re-exporting). Otherwise, no identifier can be imported
multiple times, defined multiple times, or both defined and imported.

Library names consist of a sequence of identifiers in parentheses,
followed optionally by a version consisting of a sequence of unsigned
integers:

\begin{grammar}
\ang{library~name}\longis \scheme{(\raw{\ang{identifier}}\raw{\kplus} \raw{\ang{version}})}
\\
\ang{version}\longis \ang{empty} \bar\ \scheme{(\raw{\ang{subversion}}\raw{\kplus})}\\
\\
\ang{subversion}\longis \ang{exact nonnegative integer}
\end{grammar}

Each \ang{import~spec} specifies a set of bindings to be imported into
the library, the phases in which they are to be available, and the local
names by which they are to be known.

\begin{grammar}
\ang{import~spec}\longis \ang{import~set}\\
  \orbar \scheme{(for \raw{\ang{import~set}} \raw{\ang{import~phase}}\raw{\kstar})}
\end{grammar}

Valid import phases are \scheme{run}, \scheme{expand}, \scheme{eval}, and
\scheme{(meta \var{n})}, where \scheme{run} is an abbreviation for
\scheme{(meta 0)} and \scheme{expand} is an abbreviation for
\scheme{(meta 1)}.

\begin{grammar}
\ang{import~phase}\longis \scheme{run} \bar\ \scheme{expand} \bar\ \scheme{eval} \bar\ \scheme{(meta \raw{\ang{level}})}\\
\\
\ang{level}\longis \ang{exact nonnegative integer}
\end{grammar}

Phases are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:phases}.

An \ang{import~set} names a set of bindings from another library, and
possibly specifies local names for the imported bindings.

\begin{grammar}
\ang{import~set}\longis \ang{library~reference}\\
  \orbar \scheme{(only \raw{\ang{import~set}} \raw{\ang{identifier}}\raw{\kstar})}\\
  \orbar \scheme{(except \raw{\ang{import~set}} \raw{\ang{identifier}}\raw{\kstar})}\\
  \orbar \scheme{(add-prefix \raw{\ang{import~set}} \raw{\ang{identifier}})}\\
  \orbar \scheme{(rename \raw{\ang{import~set}} (\raw{\ang{identifier}} \raw{\ang{identifier}})\raw{\kstar})}
\end{grammar}

A \ang{library~reference} identifies a library by its (possibly compound)
name and optionally by its version.

\begin{grammar}
\ang{library~reference}\longis \scheme{(\raw{\ang{identifier}}\raw{\kplus} \raw{\ang{version~reference}})}\\
\\
\ang{version~reference}\longis \ang{empty} \bar\ \scheme{(\raw{\ang{subversion~reference}}\raw{\kplus})}\\
\\
\ang{subversion~reference}\longis \ang{subversion} \bar\ \ang{subversion~condition}\\
\\
\ang{subversion~condition}\longis \scheme{(>= \raw{\ang{subversion}})}\\
                           \orbar \scheme{(<= \raw{\ang{subversion}})}\\
                           \orbar \scheme{(and \raw{\ang{subversion~condition}}\raw{\kplus})}\\
                           \orbar \scheme{(or \raw{\ang{subversion~condition}}\raw{\kplus})}\\
                           \orbar \scheme{(not \raw{\ang{subversion~condition}})}
\end{grammar}

The sequence of identifiers in the importing library's
\dangscheme{library~reference} must match the sequence of identifiers in the
imported library's \ang{library~name}.
The importing library's \ang{version~reference} specifies a predicate on a
prefix of the imported library's \ang{version}.
Each integer must match exactly and each condition has the expected meaning.
Everything beyond the prefix specified in the version reference matches
unconditionally.
When more than one library is identified by a library reference, the
choice of libraries is determined in some implementation-dependent manner.

To avoid problems such as incompatible types and replicated state, two
libraries whose library names contain the same sequence of identifiers but
whose versions do not match cannot co-exist in the same program.

By default, all of an imported library's exported bindings are made
visible within an importing library using the names given to the bindings
by the imported library.
The preceise set of bindings to be imported and the names of those
bindings can be adjusted with the \scheme{only}, \scheme{except},
\scheme{add-prefix}, and \scheme{rename} forms as described below.

\begin{itemize}
\item The \scheme{only} form produces a subset of the bindings from another
\ang{import~set}, including only the listed
\ang{identifier}s; if any of the included \ang{identifier}s is not in
\ang{import~set}, an exception is raised.
\item The \scheme{except} form produces a subset of the bindings from another
\ang{import~set}, including all but the listed
\ang{identifier}s; if any of the excluded \ang{identifier}s is not in
\ang{import~set}, an exception is raised.
\item The \scheme{add-prefix} adds a prefix to each
name from another \ang{import~set}.
\item The \scheme{rename} form, for each pair of identifiers (\ang{identifier}
\ang{identifier}), removes a binding from the set from \ang{import~set},
and adds it back with a different name. 
The first identifier is the original name, and the
second identifier is the new name. 
If the original name is not in \ang{import~set}, or
if the new name is already in \ang{import~set}, an exception is raised.
\end{itemize}

An \ang{export~set} names a set of imported and locally defined bindings to
be exported from optionally specified phases, possibly giving them different
external names.

\begin{grammar}
\ang{export~spec}\longis \ang{export~set}\\
  \orbar \scheme{(for (\raw{\ang{export~set}}\raw{\kstar}) \raw{\ang{import~phase}}\raw{\kstar})}\\
\\
\ang{export~set}\longis \ang{identifier}\\
  \orbar \scheme{(rename (\raw{\ang{identifier}} \raw{\ang{identifier}})\raw{\kstar})}
\end{grammar}

In an \ang{export~set}, an \ang{identifier} names a single binding defined
within the library or imported, where the external name for the export is
the same as the name of the binding within the library. 
A \scheme{rename} set exports the binding named by the first
\ang{identifier} in each pair, using the second \ang{identifier} as the
external name.

The \ang{library~body} of a \scheme{library} form contains definitions for
local and exported bindings and initalization expressions to be evaluated
when the library is invoked.

A \ang{library~body} is like a \scheme{lambda} body (see below) except that
the latter requires the body to contain at least one expression.

\begin{grammar}
\ang{library~body}\longis \ang{declaration}\kstar\ \ang{definition}\kstar\ \ang{command}\kstar\\
  \orbar \ang{declaration}\kstar\ \ang{definition}\kstar\ \ang{library~begin} \ang{command}\kstar\\
\\
\ang{library~begin}\longis \scheme{(begin \raw{\ang{library~body}})} \bar\ \ang{derived~library~begin}
\end{grammar}

The \ang{library~begin} is included to allow macros to expand into a sequence
including both definitions and expressions at the point where the
sequence of definitions ends and the sequence of expressions begins,
or to expand into an entire \ang{library~body}.
A \ang{derived~library~begin} is a syntactic abstraction that expands into
a \ang{library~begin}.

Declarations of the form \scheme{(declare \raw{\ang{declare~spec}})}
allow a program to specify various \emph{qualities} for the
evaluated code (see ??).
\ang{declaration}\longis \scheme{(declare \raw{\ang{declare~spec}})} \bar\ \ang{derived~declaration}%
\ \bar\ \scheme{(begin \raw{\ang{declation}\kstar})}\\
\end{grammar}
A \ang{derived~declaration} is a syntactic abstraction that expands into
a \ang{declaration}.

\FIXME{section numbers}

Definitions consist of syntax definitions using \scheme{define-syntax} (see ??), 
variable definitions using \scheme{define} (see ??),
\scheme{indirect-export} forms, \scheme{let-syntax} and \scheme{letrec-syntax} 
forms containing only definitions (see ??),
\scheme{begin} forms containing only definitions, and derived definitions.

\begin{grammar}
\ang{definition}\longis \scheme{(define-syntax \raw{\ang{keyword}} \raw{\ang{transformer~spec}})}\\
  \orbar \scheme{(define \raw{\ang{variable}})}\\
  \orbar \scheme{(define \raw{\ang{variable}} \raw{\ang{expression}})}\\
  \orbar \scheme{(define (\raw{\ang{variable}} \raw{\ang{def~formals}}) \raw{\ang{body}})}
  \orbar \scheme{(indirect-export \raw{\ang{indirect~spec}}\raw{\kstar})}\\
  \orbar \scheme{(begin \raw{\ang{definition}}\raw{\kstar})}\\
  \orbar \scheme{(let-syntax \raw{\ang{bindings}} \ang{definition}\raw{\kstar})}\\
  \orbar \scheme{(letrec-syntax \raw{\ang{bindings}} \ang{definition}\raw{\kstar})}\\
  \orbar \ang{derived~definition}\\
\\
\end{grammar}

\FIXME{(MF)
I attempted to fix \scheme{begin} by adding it to the \ang{declaration}
grammar, and by removing \ang{declaration} in the \scheme{begin} for \ang{definition}
(otherwise \scheme{(begin \raw{\ang{declaration}})}
is ambigious).

note: old begin can't be true splicing form, since decl in
\scheme{(lambda () defn1 (begin decl defn2) defn3 expr)} applies only to defn2;
for now, I flushed the \scheme{(begin decl* defn*)} definition form for now
}

A \ang{derived~definition} is a syntactic abstraction that expands into
a \ang{definition}.

\FIXME{Dropped description of lambda bodies --- covered in 5.5, right?}

%The production for \ang{body} is also relevant for \scheme{lambda}
%bodies, recalling that \ang{lambda~expression} is defined as follows.
%
%\begin{grammar}
%\ang{lambda~expression}\longis \scheme{(lambda \raw{\ang{formals}} \raw{\ang{body}})}
%\end{grammar}
%
%A \ang{body} is like a \ang{library~body} except that at least one
%expression must be present. 

The definitions of a \ang{library~body} are mutually
recursive.
The transformer expressions and transformer bindings are created
from left to right, as described in the R6RS \scheme{syntax-case}
SRFI~\cite{dybvig:srfi93}.
The variable-definition right-hand-side expressions are evalated
from left to right, as if in an implicit \scheme{letrec*},
and the body expressions are also evaluated from left to right
after the variable-definition right-hand-side expressions.

An \ang{indirect~spec} declares a set of identifiers to be indirectly
exported when a given keyword is exported.

\begin{grammar}
\ang{indirect~spec}\longis \scheme{(\raw{\ang{keyword}} \raw{\ang{identifier}}\raw{\kstar})}
\end{grammar}

The specifier declares that the transformer bound to the specified
\ang{keyword} may expand into references to the \ang{identifier}s and that
these \ang{identifier}s are to be ``indirectly exported'' for this purpose
if the \ang{keyword} is exported.
An exception is raised if any of the specified \ang{keyword}s is not
defined as a macro within the library, or if any of the associated
\ang{identifiers}s is not defined within the library.
An exception is also raised if a macro used outside of its defining
library expands into a reference to an identifier that is defined within
the library but is neither directly nor indirectly
exported from the library.
Identifiers that are not directly exported are not otherwise visible
outside of the defining library.

An \scheme{indirect-export} may appear anywhere that other definitions may
appear, so that syntactic abstractions that expand into syntax definitions
can also produce any necessary \scheme{indirect-export} forms without
concern for the context.
They are ignored everywhere except in a \ang{library~body}.

All exported bindings, explicit or implicit, are immutable both in the
exporting and importing libraries.

\subsection{Import phases\label{sec:phases}}

All bindings imported via a library's \scheme{import} form are
\emph{visible} throughout the library's \ang{library~body}.
An exception may be raised, however, if a binding is used out of its declared
phase(s):

\begin{itemize}
\item Bindings used in run-time code must be imported ``for \scheme{run}'' or
``for \scheme{(meta 0)}.''
\item Bindings used in the body of a transformer (appearing on the
right-hand-side of a transformer binding) in run-time code must be
imported ``for \scheme{expand}'' or ``for \scheme{(meta 1)},
\item Bindings used in the body of a transformer appearing within the body of a
transformer in run-time code must be imported ``for \scheme{(meta 2)},''
and so on.
\end{itemize}

The import phases of an imported binding are determined by the enclosing
\scheme{for} form, if any, in the \scheme{import} form of the importing
library, in addition to the phase of the identifier in the exporting library.
An \ang{import~set} without an enclosing \scheme{for} is equivalent to
\scheme{(for \raw{\ang{import~set}} run)}.

% FIXME: I don't know how to typeset subscripts
Import and export phases are combined by pairwise addition of all
phase combinations. For each imported identifier, if it is exported at
phases \var{n_1} through \var{n_p} and imported at phases \var{m_1}
through \var{m_q}, then the bindings are available at phases \var{n_1 * m_1},
... \var{n_p * m_1}, \var{n_2 * m_1}, ... \var{n_p * m_1}, ...
\var{n_p * m_q}.

All standard R6RS bindings are exported from the \scheme{(r6rs)} 
both ``for \scheme{expand}'' and ``for \scheme{run}.''

The import phases implicitly determine when information about a
library must be available, and also when the various forms contained within
a library must be evaluated.

Every library can be characterized by expand-time information (minimally,
its imported libraries, a list of the exported keywords, a list of the
exported variables, and code to evaluate the transformer expressions) and
run-time information (minimally, code to evaluate the variable definition
right-hand-side expressions, and code to evaluate the body expressions).
The expand-time information must be available to expand references to
any exported binding, and the run-time information must be available to
evaluate references to any exported variable binding.

If any of a library's bindings is imported by another library ``for
\scheme{expand}'' (or for any meta level greater than 0), then both expand-time and
run-time information for the first library is made available when the second
library is expanded.
If any of a library's bindings is imported by another library ``for
\scheme{run},'' the expand-time information for the first library is made available when
the second library is expanded, and the run-time information for the first
library is made available when the run-time information for the second library
is made available.
If any of a library's bindings is imported by another library ``for
\scheme{eval},'' both expand-time and run-time information for the first library
is made available when the run-time information for the second library
is made available.

We must also consider when the code to evaluate a library's transformer
expressions is executed and when the code to evaluate the library's
variable-definition right-hand-side expressions and body expressions is
executed.
We refer to executing the transformer expressions as \emph{visiting}
the library and to executing the variable-definition right-hand-side 
expressions and body expressions as \emph{invoking} the library.
A library must be visited before code that uses its bindings can be
expanded, and it must be invoked before code that uses its bindings can be executed.
Visiting or invoking a library may also trigger the visiting or
invoking of other libraries.

More precisely, visiting a library at phase $N$ causes the system to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Visit at phase $N$ any library that is imported by this library
      ``for \scheme{run}'' and that is not yet visited at phase $N$.
\item Visit at phase $N+M$ any library that is imported by this
      library ``for \scheme{(meta \var{M})},'' $M>0$ and that is not yet
      visited at phase $N+M$.
\item Invoke at phase $N+M$ any library that is imported by this
      library ``for \scheme{(meta \var{M})},'' $M>0$ and that is not yet
      invoked at phase $N+M$.
\item Evaluate the library's transformer expressions.
\end{itemize}

The order in which imported libraries are visited and invoked is not
defined, but imported libraries must be visited and invoked before the
library's transformer expressions are evaluated.

Similarly, invoking a library at meta phase $N$ causes the system to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Invoke at phase $N$ any library that is imported by this library
      ``for \scheme{run}'' and that is not yet invoked at phase $N$.
\item Evaluate the library's variable-definition right-hand-side and body
      expressions.
\end{itemize}

The order in which imported libraries are invoked is not defined, but
imported libraries must be invoked before the library's variable-definition
right-hand-side and body expressions are evaluated.

An implementation is allowed to either distinguish invocations of a
library across different phases, or to treat an invocation at any
phases as an invocation at all phases. An implementation is further
allowed to start each expansion of a \scheme{library} form by removing
all invocations of libraries above phase 0. Thus, a portable library's
meaning must not depend on whether the invocations are distinguished
or perserved across \scheme{library} expansions.

\subsection{Eval\label{sec:eval}}

The \scheme{eval} procedure accepts two arguments, an expression to
evaluate, represented as an s-expression, and an environment:

\schemedisplay
(eval \var{expression} \var{environment})
\endschemedisplay

Environments can be constructed with the \scheme{environment} procedure,
which accepts a set of import specifiers represented as s-expressions.

\schemedisplay
(environment \var{import-spec} \dots) ;=> \var{environment}
\endschemedisplay

The s-expression syntax of an \var{import-spec} mirrors the external
syntax of an \ang{import spec}.
For example:

\schemedisplay
(eval '(+ 3 4) (environment '(r6rs))) ;=> 7
\endschemedisplay

An exception is raised if the expand-time or run-time information for a
library named in one of the \var{import-specs} is not \emph{available}
when the call to \scheme{environment} occurs, in the sense of
Section~\ref{sec:phases}.

\section{Issues\label{sec:issues}}

\subsection{Simpler library names}

A single identifier, e.g., \scheme{r6rs}, could be allowed as an abbreviation
for a library name sequence containing just one identifier, e.g.,
\scheme{(r6rs)}.

\subsection{Expanding \protect\scheme{import} and \protect\scheme{export} form}

The import and export forms could be allowed in macro expansions.
In that case, the exports and imports of a library can be determined only
by macro-expanding the library.

\subsection{\protect\scheme{co-export} form}

Better support for records may be useful, possibly through a co-export
form: \scheme{(co-export \raw{\ang{co~spec}}\raw{\kstar})}, where
\ang{co~spec} contains an identifier defined or imported into a library
followed by a list of other identifiers defined or imported into the
library:

\begin{grammar}
\ang{co~spec}\longis (\ang{identifier} \ang{identifier}*)
\end{grammar}

The meaning of a \ang{co~spec} is that if the first identifier becomes
exported, either through \scheme{export} or \scheme{co-export}, then the
remaining identifiers are also exported.
Similarly, if the first identifier is indirectly exported through
\scheme{indirect-export} or \scheme{co-export}, then then remaining
identifiers are indirectly exported.

To be useful for managing records, \scheme{co-export} must be allowed in
macro expansions.
In that case, the full exports of a library can be determined only by
macro-expanding the library.

\subsection{Implicit phasing}

Instead of having the programmer declare import phases explicitly, phases
could be inferred from uses of the imported identifiers. 
In that case, determining the phase of an import would require
macro-expanding the library body.
