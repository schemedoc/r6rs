<h1>Abstract</h1><p>This SRFI defines a simple, primitive I/O subsystem for Scheme that is intended to function as the lowest layer of a more comprehensive suite of I/O layers.  It provides unbuffered I/O, and is close to what a typical operating system offers. Thus, its interface is suitable for implementing high-throughput and zero-copy I/O.</p><p>The Primitive I/O layer also allows clients to implement custom data sources and sinks via a simple interface.</p><p>Moreover, this SRFI defines a condition hierarchy specifying common I/O-related exceptional situations.</p><p>The Primitive I/O layer only handles blocking-I/O.  Non-blocking and selective I/O is left for another SRFI.</p><p>This I/O layer was designed in conjunction with two other layers that can be built on top of it: <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-80/">SRFI 80 (Stream I/O)</a> and <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-81">SRFI 81 (Port I/O)</a>.</p><h1>Rationale</h1><p>The I/O subsystem in R5RS makes it difficult for a Scheme system to implement high-performance binary I/O.  It is possible, but at the cost of complicating the interface significantly.</p><p>Moreover, R5RS provides no functionality for a program to create its own port types to connect to custom data sources and sinks.  Many Scheme implementations provide such interfaces, but they are often complicated and tend to be volatile as implementation aspects of the I/O system changes.  This is because they build directly on the port model, rather than on a more primitive model such as the one specified here, which makes it comparatively easy to implement custom data sources and sinks.</p><h1>Specification</h1><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>This SRFI refers to a number of additions and changes of the upcoming R6RS.</p><ul><li><a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-34/">SRFI 34 (Exception Handling for Programs)</a></li><li><a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-35/">SRFI 35 (Conditions)</a></li></ul><p>The specification frequently mentions <i>bytes</i> objects.  These refer to the bytes objects that will be part of the upcoming R6RS. These are equivalent in functionality to the blobs of <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-74/">SRFI 74 (Octet-Addressed Binary Blocks)</a>but differ in terminology and some aspects of the interface.</p><p>The specification also refers to <i>enum-sets</i>, which are objects representing sets of symbols.  R6RS will specify a library with various operations on enum-sets.</p><h2>Filenames</h2><p>Some of the procedures described here accept a filename <var>filename</var> as an argument.  Valid values for such a filename include strings naming a file using the native notation of the operating system the Scheme implementation happens to be running on.</p><p>It is expected that a future SRFI will extend this set of values by a more abstract representation: This is necessary, as the most common operating systems do not really use strings for representing filenames, but rather octet or word sequences.  Moreover, the string notation is difficult to manipulate and not very portable.</p><h2>Data extensions</h2><h3>Condition types</h3><p>The I/O conditition type hierarchy here is similar, but not identical to the one described in <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-36/">SRFI 36 (I/O Conditions)</a>.</p><p>The following list depicts the I/O condition hierarchy; more detailed explanations of the condition types follow.</p><ul><li><code>&amp;error</code><br><ul><li><code>&amp;i/o-error</code><br><ul><li><code>&amp;i/o-operation-error</code> (has an <code>operation</code> field)<br><ul><li><code>&amp;i/o-operation-not-available-error</code></li></ul></li><li><code>&amp;i/o-read-error</code></li><li><code>&amp;i/o-write-error</code></li><li><code>&amp;i/o-closed-error</code></li><li><code>&amp;i/o-invalid-position-error</code></li></ul><br><ul><li><code>&amp;i/o-filename-error</code> (has a <code>filename</code> field)<br><ul><li><code>&amp;i/o-malformed-filename-error</code></li><li><code>&amp;i/o-file-protection-error</code><br><ul><li><code>&amp;i/o-file-is-read-only-error</code></li></ul></li><li><code>&amp;i/o-file-already-exists-error</code></li><li><code>&amp;i/o-no-such-file-error</code></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>In exceptional situations not described as "it is an error", the procedures described in the specification below will raise an <code>&amp;i/o-error</code> condition object.  Except where explicitly specified, there is no guarantee that the raised condition object will contain all the information that would be applicable.  It is recommended, however, that an implementation of this SRFI provide all information about an exceptional situation in the condition object that is available at the place where it is detected.</p><pre>(define-condition-type &amp;i/o-error &amp;error

A file-options object is an enum-set over the symbols constituting valid file options.</p><dl><dt><code>(file-options </code><var>file-options-name...</var><code>)</code> (syntax)</dt><dd><p>The syntax <code>file-options</code> returns a file-options object with the specified options set.  The following options (all affecting output only) may be used:</p><table><tr><td><code>create</code></td><td>create file if it does not already exist</td></tr><tr><td><code>exclusive</code></td><td>an error will be raised if this option and <code>create</code> are both set and the file already exists</td></tr><tr><td><code>truncate</code></td><td>file is truncated</td></tr></table></dd></dl><h2>Readers and Writers</h2><p>The objects representing I/O descriptors are called <em>readers</em> for input and <em>writers</em> for output.  They are unbuffered and operate purely on binary data.</p><p>This layer only specifies a fairly small set of operations --- a subset of the Standard ML Basis <code>PRIM_IO</code> signature.  Specifically, all functionality related to non-blocking I/O or polling is missing here.  This is intentional, as this functionality should be integrated with the threads system of the underlying implementation, and is thus outside the scope of this SRFI.  Instead, it is expected that the set of operations available on primitive I/O readers and writers will be augmented by future specifications, as will be the available constructors for these objects.</p><p>The Primitive I/O layer has one condition type specific to readers and writers:</p><pre>(define-condition-type &amp;i/o-reader/writer-error &amp;i/o-error
  i/o-reader/writer-error?
  (reader/writer i/o-error-reader/writer))
</pre><dl><dd><p>This condition type allows specifying the particular reader or writer with which an I/O error is associated.  The <code>reader/writer</code> field has purely informational purpose.  Conditions raised by Primitive I/O procedures <em>may</em> include an <code>&amp;i/o-reader/writer-error</code> condition, but are not required to do so.</p></dd></dl><h2>I/O buffers</h2><dl><dt><code>(make-i/o-buffer </code><var>size</var><code>)</code></dt><dd><p>This creates a bytes object of size <var>size</var> with undefined contents.  Callers of the Primitive I/O procedures are encouraged to use bytes objects created by <code>make-i/o-buffer</code> because they might have alignment and placement characteristics that make <code>reader-read!</code> and <code>writer-write!</code> more efficient.  (These procedures are still required to work on regular bytes objects, however.)</p></dd></dl><h2>Readers</h2><p>A reader object typically stands for a file or device descriptor, but can also represent the output of some algorithm, such as in the case of string readers.

It only runs on a version of Scheme 48 that has not been released at the time of writing in this SRFI.</p><p>However, its actual dependencies on Scheme 48 idiosyncracies are few.  Chief are its use of the module system, which is easily replaced by another, and the implementation of Unicode.  To implement primitive readers and writers on files, the code only relies on suitable library procedures to open the files, and <code>read-byte</code> and <code>write-byte</code> procedures to read or write single bytes from a (R5RS) port, as well as a <code>force-output</code> procedure to flush a port.</p><h1>Examples</h1><p>The tarball with the reference implementation contains these examples along with test cases for them.</p><p>This customized reader reads from a list of bytes objects.
