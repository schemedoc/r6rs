<H1>Title</H1>

Port I/O (Alternative Design)

<H1>Authors</H1>

Michael Sperber and Will Clinger

<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>
This document defines an I/O layer similar in 
nature to the ports subsystem in R5RS, and provides 
conventional, imperative buffered input and output.
</p>

<p>
The layer architecture is related to the upper three layers of 
the I/O subsystem in <a href="http://www.standardml.org/Basis/">
The Standard ML Basis Library</a>.
</p>

<p>
In particular, this proposal has the following properties:
</p>
<ul>
<li>buffered reading and writing</li>
<li>binary and textual I/O, mixed if needed</li>
<li>the ability to create arbitrary I/O ports from readers and writers</li>
</ul>

<p>
In some ways, this proposal can be seen as building on the Primitive 
I/O layer specified in
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-79/">SRFI 79 (Primitive I/O)</a>.
</p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>
<p>
This document proposes a
replacement for the R5RS I/O subsystem.
</p>

<p>
The design of this document is driven by the need to resolve
the outstanding issues quickly.
It could, however, be integrated into a three-layer I/O subsystem 
where ports can be built on top of streams, as specified in
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-80/">SRFI 80 (Stream I/O)</a>.
Ports can be implemented independently, however.
</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>
This SRFI refers to a number of additions and changes of the 
upcoming R6RS.
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-34/">SRFI 34 (Exception Handling for Programs)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-35/">SRFI 35 (Conditions)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The specification frequently mentions <i>bytes</i> objects.  
These refer to the bytes objects that will be part of the 
upcoming R6RS. These are equivalent in functionality to the 
blobs of <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-74/">SRFI 74
(Octet-Addressed Binary Blocks)</a> but differ in terminology 
and some aspects of the interface.
</p>

<p>
This SRFI uses the term "the unspecified value" to refer to 
the value returned by the <code>unspecified</code> procedure, 
which is the same as the value returned by <code>(if #f #f)</code>.
</p>

<p>
This document also assumes the presence of a unique end-of-file object.
</p>

<p>
Within this document, an <i>octet</i> is an exact integer
within the closed interval [0,255].
</p>

<p>
This document assumes that the <code>char</code> datatype in 
Scheme corresponds to Unicode scalar values, and that strings
are analogous to vectors of scalar values.
(Note that this is consistent with
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-14/">SRFI 14
(Character-set library)</a> and
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-75/">SRFI 75
(R6RS Unicode data)</a>.)
</p>

<h2>Filenames</h2>

<p>
Filenames in this SRFI are the same as in
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-79/">SRFI 79
(Primitive I/O)</a>.
</p>

<h2>File options</h2>

<p>
File options are a subset of a certain set of symbols, as in
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-79">SRFI 79
(Primitive I/O)</a>.
</p>

<h2>Buffer modes</h2>
<p>
Each output port has an associated <i>buffer mode</i> that 
defines when an output operation will flush the buffer 
associated with the output port.  The possible buffer modes 
are the symbols <code>none</code> for no buffering,
<code>line</code> for flushing upon newlines, and
<code>block</code> for block-based buffering.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<code>(buffer-mode </code><var>name</var><code>)</code> (syntax)
</dt>
<dd>
<p><var>Name</var> must be one of the symbols
<code>none</code>, <code>line</code>, and <code>block</code>.
This returns the corresponding symbol denoting the associated
buffer mode.
</p>

<p>
If <var>name</var> is not one of the valid symbols, an 
exception must be raised with condition type
<code>&amp;contract</code> at macro-expansion time.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>(buffer-mode? </code><var>obj</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This returns <code>#t</code> if the argument is a valid
buffer-mode symbol, <code>#f</code> otherwise.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Text Transcoders</h2>

<p>
Several different Unicode encoding schemes describe
standard ways to encode characters and strings as byte
sequences and to decode those sequences.  With this
document, a <i>codec</i> is a Scheme object that
somehow represents a Unicode or similar encoding
scheme.
</p>

<p>
The text transcoders of this document generalize codecs
to deal with common end-of-line conventions.  Other
extensions are possible and are permitted by this
document.
</p>

<p>
A <i>transcoder</i> is an opaque object that somehow
represents some specific bidirectional (but not
necessarily lossless) translation between byte
sequences and Unicode characters and strings.
The transcoder specifies how procedures that perform
textual input are to interpret input bytes as characters
or strings.
The transcoder also specifies how procedures that
perform textual output are to translate characters
into bytes.
</p>

<p>
The procedures that perform textual input recognize
the end-of-line convention specified by their optional
transcoder argument and translate bytes or sequences
of bytes that match that convention to the linefeed
character, U+000A.
The procedures that perform textual output translate
the linefeed character into a byte or sequence of
bytes as determined by the end-of-line convention
specified by their optional transcoder argument.
If the transcoder argument to a textual input/output
procedure is omitted, the transcoder defaults to UTF-8
with a platform-specific default for the end-of-line
convention.
(<strong>FIXME:</strong> Using linefeed is a sure way
to paint ourselves into a corner.  We ought to use
the Unicode line separator, U+2028, but that might
create a problem for systems that are using some
eight-bit character set.)
</p>

<p>
(<strong>FIXME:</strong> Have we decided what to do about
this yet?)
With most transcoders, certain sequences of bytes are illegal.
If an illegal sequence of bytes is encountered during textual
input, or an attempt is made to output a character or string
that cannot be translated by the specified or default
transcoder, then one of the following will happen, but
I don't know which:
<ul>
<li>the textual input/output procedure will raise
    some specific continuable exception
<li>the textual input/output procedure will raise
    a possibly non-specific and/or non-continuable
    exception
<li>for input operations, one or more bytes are skipped,
    and the skipped bytes are silently transcoded as the
    Unicode replacement character, U+FFFD.
<li>for input operations, one or more bytes are skipped,
    and the skipped bytes are silently transcoded as some
    random character such as a question mark, U+003F.
<li>for output operations, a character is silently transcoded
    though it were the Unicode replacement character, U+FFFD.
<li>for output operations, a character is silently transcoded
    as though it were some random character such as a question
    mark, U+003F.
</ul>
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<code>(transcoder </code><code>(codec <var>codec</var>)</code>
    <code>(eol-style <var>eol-style</var>)</code><code>)</code>
    (syntax)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This constructs a transcoder object from a specified codec and 
a specified end-of-line style.  The <code>codec</code> and 
the <code>eol-style</code> clauses may appear in either order,
and are both optional.  If 
present, <var>codec</var> and <var>eol-style</var>, must be 
expressions that evaluate to a codec and an eol-style symbol
(see below), respectively.  If not present, the codec defaults 
to UTF-8, and the eol-style
symbol defaults to a platform-specific convention.
</p>

<p>
Any operands to a <code>transcoder</code> form that do not
match the above syntax may be platform-specific extensions.
The implementation is free to ignore them, but must not raise
a syntax exception.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>(update-transcoder </code><var>old</var>
    <code>(codec <var>codec</var>)</code>
    <code>(eol-style <var>eol-style</var>)</code><code>)
    </code> (syntax)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This form returns a new transcoder object constructed from an 
old one, with the <code>codec</code> and <code>eol-style</code>
fields replaced by the specified values.  The <var>old</var> 
transcoder is unaffected by the operation.
Once again, the <code>codec</code> and the <code>eol-style</code> 
clauses may appear in either order, are both optional.
Also, unrecognized operands are ignored, and do not raise an
exception.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(eol-style </code><var>name</var><code>)</code> (syntax)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<var>Name</var> must be one of the symbols <code>lf</code>,
<code>lf</code>, <code>crlf</code>, and <code>ls</code>.
</p>

<p>
This returns the symbol that denotes the corresponding
end-of-line style - <code>lf</code> stands for using U+000A,
<code>crlf</code> stands for using U+000D U+000A,
<code>cr</code> stands for using U+000D, and
<code>ls</code> stands for using the Unicode line separator,
U+2028, to signify the end of a line.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>(native-eol-style)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This returns the default end-of-line style of the underlying 
platform, e.g. <code>lf</code> on Unix and <code>crlf</code> 
on Windows.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(utf-8-codec)</code>
</dt>
<dt>
<code>(latin-1-codec)</code>
</dt>
<dt>
<code>(utf-16le-codec)</code>
</dt>
<dt>
<code>(utf-16be-codec)</code>
</dt>
<dt>
<code>(utf-32le-codec)</code>
</dt>
<dt>
<code>(utf-32be-codec)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
These are predefined codecs for the UTF-8, ISO8859-1,
UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE, UTF32-LE, and UTF-32BE encoding
schemes.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Input and Output Ports</h2>

<p>
This document described buffered and unbuffered I/O based on
<i>ports</i>.  Ports are imperative;
a get operation destructively removes data from the port, and
a put operation destructively adds data to the port, just as
in the R5RS I/O system.
</p>

<p>
The Port I/O layer introduces one condition type of its own.
</p>
<pre>(define-condition-type &amp;i/o-port &amp;i/o
  i/o-port-error?
  (port i/o-error-port))
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>
<p>
This condition type allows specifying the particular port
associated with an I/O error.  The purpose of the
<code>port</code> field is purely informational.
Conditions raised by Port I/O procedures <em>may</em>
include an <code>&amp;i/o-port-error</code> condition,
but are not required to do so.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(port? </code><var>obj</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Returns <code>#t</code> if the argument is a port,
and returns <code>#f</code> otherwise.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<a name="port-has-position?"><code>(port-has-position?
    </code><var>port</var><code>)</code></a>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This returns <code>#t</code> if the <var>port</var> supports 
the <code>port-position</code> operation (see below), 
and <code>#f</code> otherwise.
(<strong>FIXME:</strong> Does this document describe any way
to create a port that does not support that operation?)
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>(port-position </code><var>port</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Returns the exact non-negative integer index of the position
at which the next byte would be read from or written to
the port.
</p>

<p>
This procedure raises an exception 
with condition type <code>&amp;i/o-operation-not-available</code>
if the port does not support the operation.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<a name="port-has-set-port-position!?"><code>(port-has-set-port-position!?
    </code><var>port</var><code>)</code></a>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Returns <code>#t</code> if the <var>port</var> supports 
the <code>set-port-position!</code> operation (see 
below), and <code>#f</code> otherwise.
(<strong>FIXME:</strong> Does this document describe any way
to create a port that does not support that operation?)
</p>
</dd>
<dt>

<code>(set-port-position! </code><var>port</var>
    <var>pos</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<var>pos</var> must be a non-negative exact integer.
Sets the current byte position of the <var>port</var> to
<var>pos</var>.  This procedure raises an exception with 
condition type <code>&amp;i/o-operation-not-available</code> 
if the port does not support the operation.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(close-port </code><var>port</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Closes the <var>port</var>, rendering the port 
incapable of delivering or accepting data.
This has no effect if the port has already been closed.
A closed port is still a port.
The unspecified value is returned.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(call-with-port
    </code><var>port</var> <var>proc</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Calls <var>proc</var> with <var>port</var> as an argument.
If <var>proc</var> returns, then the port is closed 
automatically and the values returned by <var>proc</var> are 
returned.  If <var>proc</var> does not return, then the port 
will not be closed automatically, unless it is possible to 
prove that the port will never again be used for a lookahead,
get, or put operation.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<h3>Input ports</h3>

<p>
An input port allows reading a finite or infinite sequence
of bytes.  A finite sequence of bytes is terminated by the
end-of-file object; with some operating systems, spurious
end-of-file objects may also be seen before an end to the
sequence is reached.
With the operations described in this document,
a finite sequence of input bytes is indistinguishable from
a finite sequence of bytes followed by an infinite sequence
of end-of-file objects, so all input ports may be regarded
as infinite sequences of bytes mixed with end-of-file objects.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<code>(input-port? </code><var>obj</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Returns <code>#t</code> if the argument is an input 
port (or combined input and output port),
and returns <code>#f</code> otherwise.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(port-eof? </code><var>input-port</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Returns <code>#t</code> if the <code>lookahead-u8</code>
procedure would return the end-of-file object, and
returns <code>#f</code> otherwise.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(close-input-port </code><var>input-port</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This closes <var>input-port</var>, rendering the port 
incapable of accepting data.  This has no effect if the port 
has already been closed.  The unspecified value is returned.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(open-file-input-port </code><var>filename</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dt>
<code>(open-file-input-port
    </code><var>filename</var> <var>file-options</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This returns an input port for the named file.
The <var>file-options</var> object defaults to
<code>(file-options)</code> if not present.  It may determine 
various aspects of the returned port; see the
<a href="#file-options">section on file options</a>.
</p>

<p>
The returned input port supports the
<code>port-position</code> and
<code>set-port-position!</code> operations.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>(open-bytes-input-port </code><var>bytes</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This returns an input port whose bytes are drawn from the
bytes object <var>bytes</var>.
(<strong>FIXME:</strong> Does this operation copy the contents
of the bytes object, or do subsequent side effects to the bytes
object have unspecified and possibly bizarre interactions with
the i/o operations?)
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>(open-string-input-port </code><var>string</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This returns an input port whose bytes are drawn from the UTF-8
encoding of <var>string</var>.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(standard-input-port)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Returns an input port connected to standard input, possibly a 
fresh one on each call.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Binary input</h3>

<p>
The procedures in this section do not accept a transcoder
as an optional argument.  Some translation of the input
may occur even with these procedures, e.g. decompression
of a compressed file, but that level of translation is
beyond the scope of this document.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<code>(get-u8 </code><var>input-port</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This reads from <var>input-port</var>, blocking as necessary, 
until data is available from <var>input-port</var> or an
apparent end of the input is reached.  If a byte becomes
available, this returns that byte as an octet, and 
updates <var>input-port</var> to point just past that byte.
If no input byte is seen before an apparent end of the input
is reached, then the end-of-file object is returned.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(lookahead-u8 </code><var>input-port</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This is the same as <code>get-u8</code>, except it does
not consume the byte from the port.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(get-bytes-n </code><var>input-port</var> <var>n</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<var>n</var> must be an exact, non-negative integer, 
specifying the number of bytes to be read.
</p>

<p>
This reads from <var>input-port</var>, blocking as necessary, 
until <var>n</var> bytes are available from <var>input-port</var>
or an apparent end of the input is reached.
If <var>n</var> or more bytes are available before an
apparent end of the input, it returns a 
bytes object of size <var>n</var>.
If fewer bytes are available before an apparent end of the
input, it returns a bytes object containing those bytes.
In either case, the input port is updated to point just past
the bytes read.
If an apparent end of the input is reached before any bytes
are available, this returns the end-of-file object.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(get-bytes-n! </code><var>input-port</var>
    <var>bytes</var> <var>start</var> <var>count</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<var>count</var> must be an exact, non-negative integer, 
specifying the number of bytes to be read. <var>bytes</var> 
must be a bytes object with at least
<var>start</var> + <var>count</var> elements.
</p>

<p>
This reads from <var>input-port</var>, blocking as necessary,
until <var>count</var> are available from <var>input-port</var>
or an apparent end of the input is reached.
If <var>count</var> or more bytes are available before an
apparent end of input, they are written into <var>bytes</var> 
starting at index <var>start</var>, and the procedure returns
<var>count</var>.  If fewer bytes are available before the 
next end of file, it writes the available bytes into
<var>bytes</var> starting at index <var>start</var>, and 
returns the number of bytes actually read. In either case, the 
input port is updated to point just past the data read.
If an apparent end of the input is reached before any bytes
are available, this returns the end-of-file object.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(get-bytes-some </code><var>input-port</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This reads from <var>input-port</var>, blocking as necessary, 
until data is available from <var>input-port</var> or an
apparent end of the input is reached.  If data becomes
available, this returns a freshly allocated bytes object of
non-zero size containing that data, and updates
<var>input-port</var> to point just past that data.
If no input bytes are seen before an apparent end of the
input is reached, then the end-of-file object is returned.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(get-bytes-all </code><var>input-port</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This attempts to read all data until the next apparent end
of the input, blocking as necessary.
If one or more bytes are read, this returns a bytes object
containing all bytes up to the next apparent end of the input.
Otherwise <code>get-bytes-all</code> returns the end-of-file
object.
Note that this procedure may block indefinitely, waiting to
see an apparent end of the input, even though some bytes are
available.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Textual input</h3>

<p>
All of the procedures in this section accept a transcoder
as an optional argument.  If no transcoder is supplied,
the input bytes are interpreted as UTF-8 with a
platform-specific end-of-line convention.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<code>(get-char </code><var>input-port</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dt>
<code>(get-char </code><var>input-port</var><code> </code>
    <var>transcoder</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This reads from <var>input-port</var>, blocking as necessary, 
until the complete encoding for a character is available 
from <var>input-port</var>, or the bytes that are available
cannot be the prefix of any valid encoding, or an apparent
end of the input is reached.
</p>

<p>
If a complete character is available before the next end of 
file, <code>get-char</code> this returns that character,
and updates the input port to point past the bytes that
encoded that character.
If an apparent end of the input is reached before any bytes
are read, then <code>get-char</code> returns the end-of-file
object.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(lookahead-char </code><var>input-port</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dt>
<code>(lookahead-char </code><var>input-port</var>
    <code> </code><var>transcoder</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This is the same as <code>get-char</code>, but does not
consume any bytes from the port.  (Note that, with some
of the standard transcoders described in this document,
up to five bytes of lookahead are required.  Nonstandard
transcoders may require even more lookahead.)
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(get-string-n </code><var>input-port</var>
    <code> </code> <var>n</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dt>

    <code> </code> <var>n</var>
    <code> </code><var>transcoder</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<var>N</var> must be an exact, non-negative integer, 
specifying the number of characters to be read.
</p>

<p>
This reads from <var>input-port</var>, blocking as necessary, 
until the encodings of <var>n</var> characters (including 
invalid encodings, if they don't raise an exception) are
available, or until an apparent end of the input is reached.
</p>

<p>
If <var>n</var> or more characters are read before the end
of input, <code>get-string-n</code>
returns a string consisting of those <var>n</var>
characters.  If fewer characters are available before an
apparent end of the input, but one or more characters can
be read, it returns a string containing those characters.
In either case, the input port is updated to point just
past the data read.  If no bytes can be read before an
apparent end of the input, then the end-of-file object
is returned.
</p>
</dd>

    <var>string</var> <var>start</var> <var>count</var>
    <code> </code><var>transcoder</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This reads from <var>input-port</var> in the same manner as
<code>get-string-n</code>.
</p>

<p>
<var>count</var> must be an exact, non-negative integer, 
specifying the number of characters to be read.
If <var>count</var> or more 
characters are available before an apparent end of the input,
they are 
written into <var>string</var> starting at index <var>start</var>,
and <var>count</var> is returned.
If fewer characters are available before an apparent end
of the input, but one or more can be read, then those
characters are written into <var>string</var> 
starting at index <var>start</var>, and the number 
of characters actually read is returned.
If no bytes can be read before an apparent end of the input,
then the end-of-file object is returned.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(get-string-all </code><var>input-port</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dt>
<code>(get-string-all </code><var>input-port</var>
    <code> </code><var>transcoder</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This reads from <var>input-port</var> until an apparent
end of the input, decoding characters in the same manner as
<code>get-string-n</code> and <code>get-string-n!</code>.
</p>

<p>
If data is available before the apparent end of the input,
a string containing all the text decoded from that data is
returned.  If no data precedes the apparent end of the input,
the end-of-file object file object.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(get-line </code><var>input-port</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dt>
<code>(get-line </code><var>input-port</var>
    <code> </code><var>transcoder</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This reads from <var>input-port</var> up to and including
the next end-of-line encoding or apparent end of the input,
decoding characters in the same manner as
<code>get-string-n</code> and <code>get-string-n!</code>.
</p>

<p>
If an end-of-line encoding is read, then a string containing
all of the text up to (but not including) the end-of-line
encoding is returned, and the port is updated to point just
past the end-of-line encoding.
If an apparent end of the input is encountered before any
end-of-line encoding is read, but some bytes have been
read and decoded as characters, then a string containing
those characters is returned.
If an apparent end of the input is encountered before any
bytes are read and decoded, then the end-of-file object
is returned.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<h3>Output ports</h3>

<p>
An port is a sink to which bytes are written.
These bytes may control external devices, or may produce
files and other objects that may subsequently be opened
for input.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<code>(output-port? </code><var>obj</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This returns <code>#t</code> if the argument is an output 
port (or a combined input and output port),
and returns <code>#f</code> otherwise.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>(flush-output-port </code><var>output-port</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This flushes any output from the buffer of <var>output-port</var>
to the underlying data or device.  The unspecified value is returned.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>(output-port-buffer-mode </code><var>output-port</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This returns the symbol that represents the buffer-mode
of <var>output-port</var>.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(close-output-port </code><var>output-port</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This closes <var>output-port</var>, rendering the port 
incapable of writing data.  This has no effect if the port 
has already been closed.  The unspecified value is returned.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(open-file-output-port </code><var>filename</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dt>
<code>(open-file-output-port
    </code><var>filename</var> <var>file-options</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This returns an output port for the named file and the 
specified options (which default to <code>file-options</code>.)
The <var>buffer-mode</var> argument is optional;
it defaults to <code>block</code>.
</p>

<p>
The returned output port supports the
<code>port-position</code> and
<code>set-port-position!</code> operations.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>(call-with-bytes-output-port </code><var>proc</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<var>Proc</var> is a procedure accepting one argument.  This 
creates an unbuffered output port connected to a bytes writer, 
and calls <var>proc</var> with that output port as an 
argument.  The call to <code>call-with-bytes-output-port</code>
returns the bytes object associated with the port when
<var>proc</var> returns.
(<strong>FIXME:</strong> What does it mean for this output port
to be unbuffered?)
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(call-with-string-output-port </code><var>proc</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<var>Proc</var> is a procedure accepting one argument.  This 
creates an unbuffered output connected to a bytes writer, and 
calls <var>proc</var> with that port as an argument.  When
<var>proc</var> returns, the call to
<code>call-with-string-output-port</code> returns the string
obtained by interpreting the bytes written to the port as the
UTF-8 encoding of a string.
(<strong>FIXME:</strong> What does it mean for this output port
to be unbuffered?)
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(standard-output-port)</code>
</dt>
<dt>
<code>(standard-error-port)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Returns a port connected to the standard output or standard 
error, respectively.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Binary output</h3>

<p>
The procedures in this section do not accept a transcoder
as an optional argument.  Some translation of the output
may occur even with these procedures, e.g. compression
or packetization, but that level of translation is
beyond the scope of this document.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<code>(put-bytes
    </code><var>output-port</var> <var>bytes</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dt>
<code>(put-bytes </code><var>output-port</var>
    <var>bytes</var> <var>start</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dt>
<code>(put-bytes </code><var>output-port</var>
    <var>bytes</var> <var>start</var> <var>count</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<var>start</var> and <var>count</var> must be non-negative 
exact integers that default to 0 and
<code>(bytes-length </code><var>bytes</var><code>)</code>
- <var>start</var>, respectively.  <var>bytes</var> must have 
a size of at least <var>start</var> + <var>count</var>.  This 
writes the <var>count</var> bytes of the bytes object
<var>bytes</var>, starting at index <var>start</var>, to the 
output port.  The unspecified value is returned.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>(put-u8 </code><var>output-port</var> <var>octet</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This writes <var>octet</var> to the output port.  The 
unspecified value is returned.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Textual output</h3>

<p>
All of the procedures in this section accept a transcoder
as an optional argument.  If no transcoder is supplied,
the character(s) output will be translated to UTF-8 with
a platform-specific end-of-line convention.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<code>(put-char </code><var>output-port</var> <var>char</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dt>
<code>(put-char </code><var>output-port</var> <var>char</var>
    <code> </code><var>transcoder</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Writes an encoding of the character <var>char</var>
to the port.  The unspecified value is returned.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(put-string </code><var>output-port</var> <var>string</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dt>
<code>(put-string </code><var>output-port</var> <var>string</var>
    <code> </code><var>transcoder</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Writes an encoding of the <var>string</var>
to the port.  The unspecified value is returned.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(put-string-n
    </code><var>output-port</var> <var>string</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dt>
<code>(put-string-n </code><var>output-port</var>
    <var>string</var> <var>start</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dt>
<code>(put-string-n </code><var>output-port</var>
    <var>string</var> <var>start</var> <var>count</var><code>)</code>

<code>(put-string-n </code><var>output-port</var>
    <var>string</var> <var>start</var> <var>count</var>
    <code> </code><var>transcoder</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<var>start</var> and <var>count</var> must be non-negative 
exact integers.  <var>start</var> defaults to 0.
<var>count</var> defaults to
<code>(- (string-length <var>bytes</var>) <var>start</var>)</code>.
Writes an encoding of the substring
<code>(substring <var>string</var>
    (+ <var>start</var> <var>count</var>))</code>
to the port.  The unspecified value is returned.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(open-file-input/output-port
    </code><var>filename</var> <var>file-options</var>
    <var>buffer-mode</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This returns a single port that is both an input port and
an output port, for the named file and
options (which default to <code>(file-options)</code>).
<var>Buffer-mode</var> optionally specifies the buffer mode of 
the port; it defaults to <code>block</code>.
</p>

<p>
The returned port supports the <code>port-position</code>,
<code>set-port-position!</code>,
<code>port-position</code>, and
<code>set-port-position!</code> operations.
The same port position is used for both input and output.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Ports from readers and writers</h3>

<dl>
<dt>
<code>(open-reader-input-port </code><var>reader</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This returns an input port connected to the reader
<var>reader</var>.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<code>(open-writer-output-port </code><var>writer</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dt>
<code>(open-writer-output-port </code><var>writer</var>
    <var>buffer-mode</var><code>)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This returns an output port connected to the writer
<var>writer</var>.
<var>Buffer-mode</var> optionally specifies the buffer mode
of the port; it defaults to <code>block</code>.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<h1>Design rationale</h1>

<h3>Encoding</h3>

<p>
Many I/O system implementations allow associating an encoding 
with a port, allowing the direct use of several different 
encodings with ports.  The problem with this approach is that 
the encoding/decoding defines a mapping from binary data to 
text or vice versa.  Because of this asymmetry, such mappings 
do not compose.  The result is usually complications and 
restrictions in the I/O API, such as the inability to mix text 
or binary data.
(<strong>FIXME:</strong> As we have seen, treating transcoders
as composable mappings from binary to binary creates its own
problems.)
</p>

<p>
This proposal avoids the problem by allowing the transcoder
to be specified as optional argument to every operation that
performs textual I/O, and by specifying a default transcoder
to be used when none is specified, while also providing
operations that perform binary I/O.  Since transcoders
are associated with the operations, not with the ports,
fine-grained interleaving of binary and textual I/O
becomes possible and efficient.  The primary disadvantage
is that of having to specify an extra argument for each
use of a textual I/O operations.
</p>

<h3>Naming conventions</h3>

<p>
The procedures in this proposal follow a consistent naming 
scheme, and do not conflict with the somewhat inconsistent
naming conventions used in R5RS.
</p>

<h3><code>char-ready?</code></h3>

<p>
This proposal intentionally does not provide
<code>char-ready?</code>, which is part of R5RS.  The original 
intention of the procedure seems to have been to interface 
with something like Unix <code>select(2)</code>.  With
multi-byte encodings such as UTF-8, this is no longer 
sufficient: the procedure would really have to look at the 
actual input data in order to determine whether a complete 
character is actually present.  This makes realistic 
implementations of <code>char-ready?</code> inconsistent with 
the user's expectations.  A procedure <code>byte-ready?</code> 
would be more consistent.  On the other hand, such a procedure 
is rarely useful in real-world programs, hard to specify to 
the point where it would be portably usable, and complicates 
all layers of the I/O system, as readers would have to provide 
an additional member procedure to enable its implementation.  
Moreover, a <code>select(2)</code>-like implementation is not 
possible on all plattforms and all types of ports.  
Consequently, <code>char-ready?</code> and
<code>byte-ready?</code> are not part of this SRFI.
</p>

<h3>Optional ports and argument order</h3>

<p>
The argument order of the procedures in this SRFI is different 
from R5RS: The port is always at the beginning, and it is 
mandatory.
For a rationale, see
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-68/mail-archive/msg00031.html">the message by Taylor Campbell</a> on the subject.
</p>

<h1>Reference Implementation</h1>

<p>
No reference implementation is provided, but most of the
proposal should be straightforward to implement.
The <code>set-port-position!</code> operation is
worrisome, especially because its semantics are
somewhat unclear.
</p>

<p>
As usual, efficient implementation is less straightforward.
The efficiency of this proposal will be addressed by a separate
note.
