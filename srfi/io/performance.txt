A note on the performance of port i/o
=====================================

The purpose of this note is to sketch an efficient
implementation of the proposal for port i/o that
specifies the transcoder as an optional argument
for every textual i/o operation.

This note also contains some remarks comparing the
efficiency of that proposal to the efficiency of
associating the transcoder with a port, while
allowing the transcoder associated with a port
to be changed via side effect.


Basic observations
==================

The set of transcoders described by the proposal
is finite, and the set of transcoders supported
by an implementation is likely to be a small
finite set.  Since transcoders are an opaque
type, they can be represented by some immediate
representation that is easy to decode.

Any inefficiency caused by this proposal would
be minor in interpreted systems, because the
inefficiency of interpretation would be so much
greater.  I will therefore assume a compiled
implementation.

The performance-critical operations are get-u8,
get-char, lookahead-char, put-u8, and put-char.
Operations such as get-bytes-n, get-line, and
put-string will be more efficient than an
equivalent sequence of single-byte or single-
character operations, and the techniques that
make the single-byte and single-character
operations fast will also make the larger
operations fast, so this note will focus on
the smaller operations.

The R6RS library system will make it easy for
compilers to recognize and to optimize calls
to these procedures.  In particular, there is
no "rest argument" overhead from passing the
optional transcoder argument.

If no optional transcoder argument is passed,
then the compiler knows what the transcoder
will be, and can generate inline code for the
operation.  For example, the machine code
generated for (get-char port) on a Unix system
(with the lf eol-style) will probably look
something like

    ld      r1[nextbyte],r2
    cmp     r2,BUFSIZE
    bge     L999slowcase
    add     r1,r2,r3
    ldbyte  r3[BUF],r3
    cmpbyte r3,128
    bge     L999slowcase
    add     r2,1,r2
    store   r2,r1[nextbyte]
    shift   r3,TAGWIDTH,r3
    or      r3,CHARTAG,r3
L999slowcase_returns_here:

That's about 12 machine instructions, on average,
to obtain an ASCII character by calling get-char,
not counting the low-level i/o that fills the port
buffer when it's empty.  At 2.4 GIPS, that's
5 nanoseconds, which is not going to be limiting
unless your low-level i/o system can pump close
to 100 megabytes per second into the buffer.

The code shown above does not include runtime
checking to make sure the port is a port, that
it an input port, or that it is a buffered
input port whose buffer is of the standard
size.  Those checks will probably be hoisted
out of the loop that calls get-char, so they
are rarely executed compared to the machine
code sketched above.  Even when executed,
they are probably not much more expensive
than the code shown above, and may well be
less expensive.

If the optional transcoder argument is passed,
then the compiler will try to figure out which
particular transcoder is passed.  If it can
figure that out, it can still generate code
that resembles the code shown above.

Which transcoder is passed will be obvious if
the transcoder is constructed right at the
call to get-char.  The syntactic overhead of
doing this is fairly heavy, however, and is
likely to frighten programmers into thinking
it is slow (though it would take zero time in
reality), so programmers are likely to define
the transcoder outside the loop or somewhere
else in the library.  Either way, the compiler
can probably identify the transcoder using
flow analysis.


Digression on mutable transcoders
=================================

With the original proposal, however, the
transcoder is associated with the port, and
can be changed via side effect.  That means
the compiler probably cannot figure out which
transcoder will be used.  To figure that out,
the flow analysis would have to establish that
the port is never passed to any procedure that
might change its transcoder.

There are two reasons why that flow analysis
is more difficult than the flow analysis that
establishes the identity of an immutable
transcoder: (1) transcoders are immutable, so
passing one to an unknown procedure doesn't
interfere with the flow analysis; (2) ports,
having state, cannot be duplicated locally,
so they are more likely to be passed around
through multiple procedures.

I suspect that the design featuring ports
whose transcoders could be changed via side
effect was based upon the belief that large
volumes of data could be transcoded and
buffered.  That doesn't work very well when
a port's transcoder can change through side
effect---you'd have to throw buffered data
away and do the transcoding again---or when
mixing what I mean by binary i/o with textual
i/o.


Minor details
=============

The lookahead-char procedure might find that
some of the bytes it needs to look at have
not yet been loaded into the buffer.  That
implies a minor deviation from the usual
model in which a buffer is emptied completely
before refilling.  There would have to be
enough overlap so the beginning of a
character encoding remains in the buffer.
With 1000-byte buffers, a 5-byte overlap
would be insignificant.

The put-char procedure would have a similar
issue, with a similar solution.

The main reasons why the procedures that deal
with longer sequences of bytes would be faster
are: (1) the benefits of loop unrolling; (2)
the benefits of hoisting runtime checks (Is
this a port?  Is it an output port?  Is it
buffered in the standard way?) outside the
loop.  Compiler optimization achieves these
benefits automatically.  Hand-written code
might do slightly better, but is probably
not going to be worthwhile in systems that
have good compilers.


Getting the transcoder from the port
====================================

Some ports, e.g. stdio on Unix, actually have some
idea of what transcoder would be most appropriate
for them, perhaps from locale information or from
Windows code pages (?).  We therefore decided that
ports can be queried to find out what transcoder
they think might be best, but that this transcoder
cannot be changed via side effect.  We further
agreed that read-char (and presumably write-char
and the other procedures in the simple i/o library)
would query the port to get the transcoder, while
get-char and the other new procedures would not,
as in:

    (define (read-char port)
      (get-char port (port-locale-transcoder port)))

Since the transcoder associated with a port cannot
be changed by side effect, its extraction from a
port is more likely to be hoisted out of loops than
under the original proposal.  In systems that
associate the same transcoder with all ports, of
course, the compiler will know which transcoder to
use.  In systems that associate the same transcoder
with all ports that are created in the same way,
the compiler may have a good chance of deducing
the specific port.

When the transcoder cannot be determined by the
compiler, however, calls to the read-char procedure
are unlikely to be coded inline.


Benchmarks
==========

The following table shows how many ASCII characters
can be read in one second by several current systems.
The first column is for a benchmark that performs a
full procedure call for each character; its purpose
is to estimate the performance that would be lost by
calling the simple i/o library's version read-char
instead of get-char.  The other columns use current
implementations of R5RS's read-char to estimate the
performance of R6RS get-char.

Examples
========

; The following definition assumes that an exception
; handler for illegal encodings has been established
; that continues by treating the illegal encoding as
; the replacement character.

(define (guess-the-transcoder port)
  (let* ((zwnbsp #\xfeff)
         (utf-8    (transcoder (codec (utf-8-codec))))
         (utf-16le (transcoder (codec (utf-16le-codec))))
         (utf-16be (transcoder (codec (utf-16be-codec))))
         (utf-32le (transcoder (codec (utf-32le-codec))))
         (utf-32be (transcoder (codec (utf-32be-codec))))
         (c8       (lookahead-char port utf-8))
         (c16le    (lookahead-char port utf-16le))
         (c16be    (lookahead-char port utf-16be))
         (c32le    (lookahead-char port utf-32le))
         (c32be    (lookahead-char port utf-32be)))
    (cond ((char=? c8 zwnbsp)
           utf8)
          ((char=? c16le zwnbsp)
           utf-16le)
          ((char=? c16be zwnbsp)
           utf-16be)
          ((char=? c32le zwnbsp)
           utf-32le)
          ((char=? c32be zwnbsp)
           utf-32be)
          (else
           utf-8))))

; The following procedure is likely to be inefficient
; because the compiler cannot deduce the transcoder.
; The compiler will probably generate closed calls to
; get-char, which will have to interpret the transcoder
; on each call.  (That interpretation, or dynamic method
; dispatch if you prefer, would also have been necessary
; with the proposal that associated transcoders with
; ports, and changed the transcoder via side effect.)

(define (get-string-all-by-guessing-transcoder port)
  (let ((transcoder (guess-the-transcoder port))
        (utf-8 (transcoder (codec utf-8))))
    (call-with-string-output-port
     (lambda (out)
       (do ((c (get-char port transcoder)
               (get-char port transcoder)))
           ((eof-object? c))
         (put-char out c utf-8))))))

; The following procedure should be efficient.
; (Its analogue would also have been efficient
; with the proposal that associated transcoders
; with ports, and changed the transcoder via side
; effects.)

(define (get-string-all-by-guessing-transcoder port)
  (get-string-all port (guess-the-transcoder port)))
