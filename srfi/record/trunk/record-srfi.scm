       "This SRFI is being submitted by members of the Scheme "
       "Language Editor's Committee as part of the Scheme standardization "
       "process.  The purpose of such ``R6RS SRFIs'' is to inform the Scheme "
       "community of features and design ideas under consideration by the "
       "editors and to allow the community to give the editors some direct "
       "feedback that will be considered during the design process.")

      (p

       "When the R6RS specification is finalized, the SRFI may be revised to "
       "conform to the R6RS specification and then resubmitted with the intent "
       "to finalize it.  This procedure aims to avoid the situation where this "
       "SRFI is inconsistent with R6RS.  An inconsistency between R6RS and "
       "this SRFI could confuse some users.  Moreover it could pose "
       "implementation problems for R6RS compliant Scheme systems that aim to "
       "support this SRFI.  Note that departures from the SRFI specification "
       "by the Scheme Language Editor's Committee may occur due to other "
       "design constraints, such as design consistency with other features "
       "that are not under discussion as SRFIs. ")

      (h1 "Abstract")

      (p
       "This SRFI describes abstractions for creating new data types representing "
       "records - data structures with named fields.  This SRFI comes in four "
       "parts:")

      (ul
       (li
        "a procedural layer for creating and manipulating record types and record
         instances")
       (li
        "an explicit-naming syntactic layer for defining the various entities associated "
        "with a record type "
        "- construction procedure, predicate, field accessors, mutators, etc. - at once")
       (li
        "an implicit-naming syntactic layer built on top of the explicit-naming syntactic "
        "layer, which chooses the names for the various products based on the names of "
        "the record type and fields")
       (li
        "a set of reflection procedures"))

      (h1 "Rationale")

      (p
       "The procedural layer allows dynamic construction of new record types and "
       "associated procedures for creating and manipulating records, "
       "which is particularly useful when writing interpreters that "
       "construct host-compatible record types.  It may also serve as a target "
       "for expansion of the syntactic layers.")

      (p
       "The procedural layer allows record types to be extended.  This allows "
       "using record types to naturally model hierarchies that occur in applications "
       "like algebraic data types, and also single-inheritance class systems.  "
       "This model of extension has a well-understood representation that is simple "
       "to implement.")

      (p
       "The explicit-naming syntactic layer provides a basic syntactic interface "
       "whereby a single record definition serves as a shorthand for the definition "
       "of several record creation and manipulation routines: a construction procedure, "
       "a predicate, field accessors, and field mutators. "
       "As the name suggests, the explicit-naming syntactic layer requires the "
       "programmer to name each of these products explicitly. "
       "The explicit-naming syntactic layer is similar to "
       (a (@ (href "http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-9/")) "SRFI 9: Defining Record Types") ", "
       "but adds several features, including single inheritance and non-generative "
       "record types.")

      (p
       "The implicit-naming syntactic layer extends the explicit-naming syntactic layer "
       "by allowing the names for the construction procedure, predicate, accessors, and mutators "
       "to be determined automatically from the name of the record and names of "
       "the fields.  This establishes a standard naming convention and allows "
       "record-type definitions to be more succinct, with the downside that the "
       "product definitions cannot easily be located via a simple search for the "
       "product name.  The programmer may override some or all of the default names "
       "by specifying them explicitly as in the explicit-naming syntactic layer.")

      (p
       "The syntax of both syntactic layers is also designed to allow future extensions "
       "by using clauses introduced by keywords.")

      (p
       "The two layers are designed to be fully compatible; the implicit-naming layer is simply "
       "a conservative extension of the explicit-naming layer.  The goal is to "
       "make both explicit-naming and implicit-naming definitions reasonably natural "
       "while allowing a seamless transition between explicit and implicit naming.")

      (p
       "The reflection procedures allow programs to obtain from a record instance "
       "a descriptor for the type and from there obtain access to the fields of "
       "the record instance.  This allows the creation of portable printers and "
       "inspectors.  A program may prevent access to a record's type and thereby "
       "protect the information stored in the record from the reflection mechanism "
       "by declaring the type " (i "opaque") ".  Thus, opacity as presented here "
       "can be used to enforce abstraction barriers.")

      (p
       "Fresh record types may be generated at different times---for example, when "
       "a record-type-defining form is expanded, or when it is evaluated.  The available "
       "choices all have different advantages and trade-offs.  These typically "
       "come into play when a record-type-defining form may be evaluated multiple times, "
       "for example, as part of interactive operation of the Scheme system, or as a body "
       "form of an abstraction.  The SRFI leaves the default generativity largely "
       "unspecified to allow different implementations, but also provides for "
       "non-generativity, which guarantees that the evaluation of identical "
       "record-type-defining forms yields compatible record types.")
       

      (h1 "Issues")

      (ul
       (li 
	(p
        "The name " (code "define-record-type") " is used for both the "
        "implicit-naming and explicit-naming syntactic interfaces. "
        "It is unclear whether both names should in fact be the same. "
        "With different names it would be easier to identify when only "
        "the explicit-naming interface is being used; presumably, "
        "a module system would also make this possible.  "
	"On the other hand, with different names it would also be "
	"more difficult to transition between the two interfaces, "
	"and the name to use for partly implicit, partly explicit record "
	"definitions might not be obvious."))

       (li
	(p
	 "Compared to some other record-defining forms that have been proposed and implemented, "
	 "the syntax is comparatively verbose.  For instance, PLT Scheme has a "

      (h1 (a (@ (name "design-rationale")) "Design Rationale"))

      (h2 "Constructor constructors, makers, and constructors")

      (p
       "The proposal contains infrastructure for creating specialized constructors, "
       "rather than just creating default constructors that just accept the initial "
       "values of all the fields as arguments.  This infrastructure achives "
       "full generality while leaving each level of an inheritance hierarchy "
       "in control over its own fields and allowing child record definitions "
       "to be abstracted away from the actual number and contents of parent "
       "fields.")
      (p
       "The design allows the initial values of the fields "
       "to be specially "
       "computed or default to constant values.  It also allows for operations to be "
       "performed on or with the resulting record, such as the registration "
       "of a widget record for finalization. "
       "Moreover, the maker mechanism allows the creation of such initializers in a "
       "modular manner, separating the initialization concerns of the "
       "parent types of those of the extensions.")
      (p
       "During the design phase as well as the discussion period of the SRFI, we "
       "experimented with several mechanisms for achieving this purpose; "
       "the one described here "
       "achieves complete generality without cluttering the syntactic layer, "
       "possibly sacrificing a bit of notational convenience in special cases, as "
       "compared to previous versions of this proposal.")

      (h2 "Non-distinct field names")

      (p
       "The field names provided as an argument to " (code "make-record-type-descriptor")
       " and in the syntactic layers are only for informational purposes for use in, say, "
       "debuggers.  They aren't actively used "
       "anywhere else in the interface (though they were in an earlier draft) "
       "except for the implicit generation of field names in the implicit-naming "
       "syntactic layer, where there is a restriction "
       "on duplicate names. "
       "There has been some discussion on this issue "
       (a (@ (href "http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-76/mail-archive/msg00061.html")) "here") ".")
      (p
       "On the practical side, we decided not to require distinctness "
       "because it is inconvenient "
       "for a macro that calls " (code "make-record-type-descriptor") " to arrange for the "
       "names it provides to be both unique and meaningful.  Moreover, a symbolic "
       "key would have to be combined with the record-type it appears in to "
       "uniquely reference a field, as disallowing duplicate field names between "
       "a record type and its extensions would break important abstraction barriers.")
      (p
       "From a more principled perspective, the record abstractions described here "
       "don't use names as keys into record values (any more) but instead indices "
       "relative to the record type.  Abstractions that do use keys could be "
       "layered on top of the facilities described here.  These would certainly be "
       "useful to enable, say, pattern-matching or separate abstractions that refer "
       "to fields by name, but are outside the scope of this proposal.")

      (h2 "No multiple inheritance")

      (p
       "Multiple inheritance could be formulated as an extension of the present "
       "system, but it would raise more complex semantic and implementation issues "
       "(sharing among common parent types, among other things) than we are prepared "
       "to handle at this time.")

      (p
       "The procedural layer of this SRFI is essentially an extension of "
       "a proposal that was considered by "
       "the R*RS authors about 15 years ago, and was supported at that "
       "time by a vote of approximately 28 to 2.  On 1 September 1989, "
       "Pavel Curtis posted the proposal to rrrs-authors.  Norman Adams "
       "reposted Pavel's proposal on 5 February 1992. "
       "Kent Dybvig presented an extended version of Pavel's proposal along "
       "with a syntactic interface, both developed in collaboration with Bill Rozas, "
       "at the 1998 Scheme Worshop. "
       "Pavel's proposal was also a starting point for Chez Scheme's procedural "
       "interface. "
       "The mechanism for defining and using constructor arguments in the "
       "syntactic interface is similar to the syntax used by "
       "the Scheme Widget Library for class definitions. "
       "Single inheritance was added to Larceny in 1998 and Chez Scheme in 1999, "
       "but it is likely that other implementations had inheritance before then.")
