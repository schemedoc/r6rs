      (p 
       "This SRFI is being submitted by a member of the Scheme "
       "Language Editor's Committee as part of the Scheme standardization "
       "process.  The purpose of such ``R6RS SRFIs'' is to inform the Scheme "
       "community of features and design ideas under consideration by the "
       "editors and to allow the community to give the editors some direct "
       "feedback that will be considered during the design process.")

      (p
       "At the end of the discussion period, this SRFI will be withdrawn. "
       "When the R6RS specification is finalized, the SRFI may be revised to "
       "conform to the R6RS specification and then resubmitted with the intent "
       "to finalize it.  This procedure aims to avoid the situation where this "
       "SRFI is inconsistent with R6RS.  An inconsistency between R6RS and "
       "this SRFI could confuse some users.  Moreover it could pose "
       "implementation problems for R6RS compliant Scheme systems that aim to "
       "support this SRFI.  Note that departures from the SRFI specification "
       "by the Scheme Language Editor's Committee may occur due to other "
       "design constraints, such as design consistency with other features "
       "that are not under discussion as SRFIs. ")

      (h1 "Abstract")

      (p
       "This SRFI describes abstractions for creating new data types representing "
       "records - data structures with named fields.  This SRFI comes in four "
       "parts:")

      (ul
       (li
        "a procedural layer for creating and manipulating record types and record
         instances")
       (li
        "an explicit-naming syntactic layer for defining the various entities associated "
        "with a record type "
        "- construction procedure, predicate, field accessors, mutators, etc. - at once")
       (li
        "an implicit-naming syntactic layer built on top of explicit-naming syntactic "
        "layer, which chooses the names for the various products based on the names of "
        "the record type and fields")
       (li
        "a set of reflection procedures"))

      (h1 "Rationale")

      (p
       "The procedural layer allows dynamic construction of new record types and "
       "associated procedures for creating and manipulating records, "
       "which is particularly useful when writing interpreters that "
       "construct host-compatible record types.  It may also serve as a target "
       "for expansion of the syntactic layers.")

      (p
       "The explicit-naming syntactic layer provides a basic syntactic interface "
       "whereby a single record definition serves as a shorthand for the definition "
       "of several record creation and manipulation routines: a construction procedure, "
       "a predicate, accessors, and mutators. "
       "As the name suggests, the explicit-naming syntactic layer requires the "
       "programmer to name each of these products explicitly. "
       "The explicit-naming syntactic layer is similar to "
       (a (@ (href "http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-9/")) "SRFI 9: Defining Record Types") ", "
       "but adds several features, including single inheritance and non-generative "
       "record types.")

      (p
       "The implicit-naming syntactic layer extends the explicit-naming syntactic layer "
       "by allowing the names for construction procedure, predicate, accessors, and mutators "
       "to be determined automatically from the name of the record and names of "
       "the fields.  This establishes a standard naming convention and allows "
       "record-type definitions to be more succinct, with the downside that the "
       "product definitions cannot easily be located via a simple search for the "
       "product name.  The programmer may override some or all of the default names "
       "by specifying them explicitly as in the explicit-naming syntactic layer.")

      (p
       "The syntax of both syntactic layers is also designed to allow future extensions "
       "by using clauses introduced by keywords.")

      (p
       "The two layers are designed to be fully compatible; the implicit-naming layer is simply "
       "a conservative extension of the explicit-naming layer.  The goal is to "
       "make both explicit-naming and implicit-naming definitions reasonably natural "
       "while allowing a seamless transition between explicit and implicit naming.")

      (p
       "The reflection procedures allow programs to obtain from a record instance "
       "a descriptor for the type and from there obtain access to the fields of "
       "the record instance.  This allows the creation of portable printers and "
       "inspectors.  A program may prevent access to a record's type and thereby "
       "protect the information stored in the record from the reflection mechanism "
       "by declaring the type " (i "opaque") ".")

      (p
       "Fresh record types may be generated at different times---for example, when "
       "a record-type-defining form is expanded, or when it is evaluated.  The available "
       "choices all have different advantages and trade-offs.  These typically "
       "come into play when a record-type-defining form may be evaluated multiple times, "
       "for example, as part of interactive operation of the Scheme system, or as a body "
       "form of an abstraction.  The SRFI leaves the default generativity largely "
       "unspecified to allow different implementations, but also provides for "
       "non-generativity, which guarantees that the evaluation of identical "
       "record-type-defining forms yields compatible record types.")
       

      (h1 "Issues")

      (ul
       (li 
        "The name " (code "define-type") " is used for both the "
        "implicit-naming and explicit-naming syntactic interfaces. "
        "It is unclear whether both names should in fact be the same. "
        "With different names it would be easier to identify when only "
        "the explicit-naming interface is being used; presumably, "
        "a module system would also make this possible.")

       (li
	(p
	 "Compared to some other record-defining forms that have been proposed and implemented, "
	 "the syntax is comparatively verbose.  For instance, PLT Scheme has a "

       "arguments.")

      (p
       "If the custom field initialization were omitted, it would still be possible to perform "
       "custom initialization by writing a separate constructor procedure, which "
       "would wrap a record type's actual constructor.  See the previous item on why "
       "that would create difficulties.")


      (h2 (code "init!") " clause")

      (p
       "When constructing records, custom initialization code is commonly "
       "required, because the initial field values often do not have a "
       "one-to-one correspondence to the constructor arguments.  There may also "
       "be a need to perform other construction-time initialization, such as "
       "calling a procedure to \"register\" the new record.")

      (p
       "Internally, record construction involves an initialization step, and the "
       (code "init!") " clause provides a hook into this step, in order to "
       "support custom initialization.")

      (p
       "If this feature were omitted, many record-type definitions would require "
       "a separate constructor procedure, with the same consequences as explained "
       "above in the section on field initialization.")

      (p
       "The " (code "init!") " clause addresses this common requirement by "
       "allowing arbitrary operations on the new record instance, before it is "
       "returned from the constructor.  This eliminates the need to define a "
       "constructor wrapper procedure, and means that the record type's defined "
       "constructor can always be the actual constructor used by clients.")

      (h2 "Distinct field names")

      (p
       "The field names must be distinct in the syntactic layers, but not in the "
       "procedural ones.  They must be distinct in the syntactic layers to avoid "
       "having to compute indexes there.  As to the procedural layer, calls "
       "to " (code "make-record-type-descriptor") " might be generated by a macro where "
       "the field names are generated; this is awkward to achieve with " (code "syntax-rules")
       ".")

       "Pavel Curtis posted the proposal to rrrs-authors.  Norman Adams "

       "Kent Dybvig presented an extended version of Pavel's proposal along "

       "at the 1998 Scheme Worshop. "
       "Pavel's proposal was also a starting point for Chez Scheme's procedural "

       "The mechanism for defining and using constructor arguments in the "
       "syntactic interface is similar to the syntax used by "
       "the Scheme Widget Library for class definitions. "
