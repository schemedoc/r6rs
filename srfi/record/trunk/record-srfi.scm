       "This SRFI is being submitted by a member of the Scheme "
       "Language Editor's Committee as part of the Scheme standardization "
       "process.  The purpose of such ``R6RS SRFIs'' is to inform the Scheme "
       "community of features and design ideas under consideration by the "
       "editors and to allow the community to give the editors some direct "
       "feedback that will be considered during the design process.")

      (p
       "At the end of the discussion period, this SRFI will be withdrawn. "
       "When the R6RS specification is finalized, the SRFI may be revised to "
       "conform to the R6RS specification and then resubmitted with the intent "
       "to finalize it.  This procedure aims to avoid the situation where this "
       "SRFI is inconsistent with R6RS.  An inconsistency between R6RS and "
       "this SRFI could confuse some users.  Moreover it could pose "
       "implementation problems for R6RS compliant Scheme systems that aim to "
       "support this SRFI.  Note that departures from the SRFI specification "
       "by the Scheme Language Editor's Committee may occur due to other "
       "design constraints, such as design consistency with other features "
       "that are not under discussion as SRFIs. ")

      (h1 "Abstract")

      (p
       "This SRFI describes abstractions for creating new data types representing "
       "records - data structures with named fields.  The proposal comes in three "
       "parts:")

      (ul
       (li
	"a procedural layer for explaining the semantics of records, and for "
	"introspection and reflection; it has library status")
       (li
	"an explicit-naming syntactic layer for defining the various entities associated "
	"with a record type "
	"- constructor, predicate, field accessors, mutators, etc. - at once; "
	"it has primitive status")
       (li
	"an implicit-naming syntactic layer built on top of explicit-naming syntactic "
	"layer, which chooses the names for the various entities based on the name of "
	"the record type; it has library status"))

      (h1 "Rationale")

      (p
       "The explicit-naming syntactic layer described here is similar to "
       (a (@ (href "http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-9/")) "SRFI 9: Defining Record Types") ". "
       "However, it contains some modest functionality extensions to the record types:")
      
      (ul
       (li "single inheritance")
       (li "non-generative record types"))

      (p
       "Also, the procedural layer (already present in the reference implementation of "
       "SRFI 9) is now part of the specification, and allows introspection, the implementation "
       "of portable debuggers and metacircular interpreters that manipulate records compatibly "
       "with the host language.")

      (p
       "The syntax is designed to allow future extensions via keyworded clauses.")

      (p
       "The syntax is designed in such a way as to obviate having to write separate "
       "constructor procedures that shuffle arguments, provide default values for fields, "
       "and/or register the created objects.")

      (p
       "The implicit-naming layer chooses names for the constructor, predicate, "
       "accessors, and mutators based on the name of the record type.  This "
       "makes record-type definitions more succinct and prescribes a standard "
       "naming convention.  This has the cost of binding identifiers that do "
       "not occur verbatim in the source code, thus hiding them from tools like "
       (code "grep(1)") ", and possibly causing confusion among programmers "
       "new to Scheme.")

      (p
       "The two layers were designed in tandem; the implicit-naming layer is simply "
       "a conservative extension of the explicit-naming layer.  The goal was to "
       "make explicit-naming definitions reasonably natural and allowing a seamless "
       "\"upgrade\" to implicit naming.")

      (h1 "Issues")

      (ul
       (li 
	"The names " (code "define-record-type/explicit") " and "
	(code "define-record-type/implicit") " are obviously unsatisfactory and need "
	"to be replaced eventually.  It is open whether both names should in fact "
	"be the same.   This raises the question of how to distinguish them; presumably "
	"a module system would allow that.")
       (li
	(p
	 "Compared to some other record-defining forms that have been proposed and implemented, "
	 "the syntax is comparatively verbose.  For instance, PLT Scheme has a "
	 (code "define-struct") " form that allows record-type definitions as short as this:")
	(verbatim
	 "(define-struct point (x y))")
	(p
	 "This proposal requires at least:")
	(verbatim
	 "(define-record-type/implicit point (x y)"
	 "  (fields ((mutable x) x)"
	 "          ((mutable y) y)))")
	(p
	 "Arguably, the added verbosity contains valuable information.  Moreover, "
	 "it is trivial to define forms like " (code "define-struct") " on top "
	 "of this proposal.")
	(p
	 "It would be possible to introduce abbreviations into the syntax. "
	 "In the " (code "fields") " clause, a single identifier could serve as a shorthand "
	 "for a " (code "mutable") " or " (code "immutable") " clause:")
	(verbatim
	 "(define-record-type/implicit point (x y)"
	 "  (fields (x x)"
	 "          (y y)")
	(p
	 "Even more radically, a default " (code "fields") " clause could be provided:")
	(verbatim
	 "(define-record-type/implicit point (x y))")
	(p
	 "Again, this conciseness comes at the cost of more obscure semantics")))

      (p
