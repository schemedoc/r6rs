       "This SRFI is being submitted by a member of the Scheme "
       "Language Editor's Committee as part of the Scheme standardization "
       "process.  The purpose of such ``R6RS SRFIs'' is to inform the Scheme "
       "community of features and design ideas under consideration by the "
       "editors and to allow the community to give the editors some direct "
       "feedback that will be considered during the design process.")

      (p
       "At the end of the discussion period, this SRFI will be withdrawn. "
       "When the R6RS specification is finalized, the SRFI may be revised to "
       "conform to the R6RS specification and then resubmitted with the intent "
       "to finalize it.  This procedure aims to avoid the situation where this "
       "SRFI is inconsistent with R6RS.  An inconsistency between R6RS and "
       "this SRFI could confuse some users.  Moreover it could pose "
       "implementation problems for R6RS compliant Scheme systems that aim to "
       "support this SRFI.  Note that departures from the SRFI specification "
       "by the Scheme Language Editor's Committee may occur due to other "
       "design constraints, such as design consistency with other features "
       "that are not under discussion as SRFIs. ")

      (h1 "Abstract")

      (p
       "This SRFI describes abstractions for creating new data types representing "
       "records - data structures with named fields.  The proposal comes in three "
       "parts:")

      (ul
       (li
        "a procedural layer for creating and manipulating record types and record
         instances; it has primitive status")
       (li
        "an explicit-naming syntactic layer for defining the various entities associated "
        "with a record type "
        "- constructor, predicate, field accessors, mutators, etc. - at once; "
        "it has primitive status")
       (li
        "an implicit-naming syntactic layer built on top of explicit-naming syntactic "
        "layer, which chooses the names for the various products based on the names of "
        "the record type and fields; it has library status")
       (li
        "a set of reflection procedures; it has library status"))

      (h1 "Rationale")

      (p
       "The procedural layer allows dynamic construction of new record types and "
       "associated procedures for creating and manipulating records, "
       "which is particularly useful when writing interpreters that "
       "construct host-compatible record types.  It may also serve as a target "
       "for expansion of the syntactic layers.")

      (p
       "The explicit-naming syntactic layer provides a basic syntactic interface "
       "whereby a single record definition serves as a shorthand for the definition "
       "of several record creation and manipulation routines: a constructor, "
       "a predicate, accessors, and mutators. "
       "As the name suggests, the explicit-naming syntactic layer requires the "
       "programmer to name each of these products explicitly. "
       "The explicit-naming syntactic layer is similar to "
       (a (@ (href "http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-9/")) "SRFI 9: Defining Record Types") ", "
       "but adds several features, including single inheritance and non-generative "
       "record types.")

      (p
       "The implicit-naming syntactic layer extends the explicit-naming syntactic layer "
       "by allowing the names for constructor, predicate, accessors, and mutators "
       "to be determined automatically from the name of the record and names of "
       "the fields.  This establishes a standard naming convention and allows "
       "record-type definitions to be more succinct, with the downside that the "
       "product definitions cannot easily be located via a simple search for the "
       "product name.  The programmer may override some or all of the default names "
       "by specifying them explicitly as in the explicit-naming syntactic layer.")

      (p
       "The syntax of both syntactic layers is designed to obviate "
       "separate constructor procedures that shuffle arguments, provide default "
       "values for fields, and/or perform initialization actions on the created "
       "instance, such as registering it in some manner.")

      (p
       "The syntax of both syntactic layers is also designed to allow future extensions "
       "via keyworded clauses.")

      (p
       "The two layers are designed to be fully compatible; the implicit-naming layer is simply "
       "a conservative extension of the explicit-naming layer.  The goal is to "
       "make both explicit-naming and implicit-naming definitions reasonably natural "
       "while allowing a seamless transition between explicit and implicit naming.")

      (p
       "The reflection procedures allow programs to obtain from a record instance "
       "a descriptor for the type and from there obtain access to the fields of "
       "the record instance.  This allows the creation of portable printers and "
       "inspectors.  A program may prevent access to a record's type and thereby "
       "protect the information stored in the record from the reflection mechanism "
       "by declaring the type " (i "opaque") ".")

      (h1 "Issues")

      (ul
       (li 
        "The name " (code "define-type") " is used for both the "
        "implicit-naming and explicit-naming syntactic interfaces. "
        "It is unclear whether both names should in fact be the same. "
        "With different names it would be easier to identify when only "
        "the explicit-naming interface is being used; presumably, "
        "a module system would also make this possible.")

       (li
	(p
	 "Compared to some other record-defining forms that have been proposed and implemented, "
	 "the syntax is comparatively verbose.  For instance, PLT Scheme has a "
	 (code "define-struct") " form that allows record-type definitions as short as this:")
	(verbatim
	 "(define-struct point (x y))")
	(p
	 "The " (a (@ (href "#design-rationale")) "Design Rationale section")
	 " explains why.")
        (p
         "It would be possible to introduce abbreviations into the syntax. "
         "In the " (code "fields") " clause, a single identifier might serve as a shorthand "
         "for a " (code "mutable") " clause:")
        (verbatim
         "(define-type point (x y) (fields (x x) (y y)))")
        (p
         "Even more radically, a default " (code "fields") " clause could be provided, "
         "with the constructor formals serving as implicit field names and initializers:")
        (verbatim
         "(define-type point (x y))")
	(p
	 "Allowing such abbreviations would make some record definitions more "
	 "concise but may also discourage programmers from specifying valuable "
	 "field mutability information and taking advantage of nontrivial "
	 "field initializers.  In any case, it is trivial to define forms like "
	 (code "define-struct") " on top of this proposal."))

       (li
	(p
	 "Similarly, one might allow plain symbols to be used as field specifiers "
	 "in the " (var "fields") " argument to " (code "make-record-type-descriptor")
	 ", defaulting to mutability or immutability."))
       
       (li
	(p
	 "Should syntactic record-type definitions default to creating opaque or "
	 "non-opaque record types?"))
       (li
	(p
	 "The specification of " (code "make-record-type-descriptor") " has this:")
	(p
	 (blockquote
	 "If " (var "parent") " is not " (code "#f") ", and " (var "uid")
	 " is not " (code "#f") ", and the parent is generative "
	 " (i.e. its uid is " (code "#f") "), an error is signalled."))
	(p
	 "However, the semantics would be perfectly clear even in the error case "
	 "described above.  Should this restriction be lifted, if only for reasons "
	 "of simplicity?"))
       (li
	(p
	 "The specification of " (code "eq?") " on records prevents certain kinds "
	 "of unboxing optimizations.  Should instead the following hold:")
	(verbatim
	 "(let ((r (construct ...)))"
	 "  (eqv? r r))               ==> #t"
	 "(let ((r (construct ...)))"
	 "  (eq? r r))                ==> unspecified"))
       (li
	(p
	 "The semantics of generativity for the syntactic record-type-definition forms "
	 "is presently unspecified.  Should this be tightened, and, if so, to what kind "
	 "of generativity?")))
