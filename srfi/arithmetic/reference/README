This is the reference implemenation of the R6RS Arithmetic SRFI.

See COPYING for license information.

It is written in R5RS Scheme  with few exceptions:

- There may be name clashes between the different modules that
  constitute the code.

- The fixnum code uses the underlying implementations of the bitwise
  operators; portable implementations are available as part of SRFI 60.

- The code uses SRFI 9 (Defining Record Types).

- The code uses the Scheme 48 DEFINE-RECORD-DISCLOSER procedure to
  make the number objects print; these may be deleted without loss of
  functionality.

- Numerous modules assume an underlying IEEE-754-like representation
  for flonums; they are clearly marked in the module definitions as
  having dependencies on the FLONUMS-IEEE structure.

The code assumes a certain minimal fixnum range:

- the lengths of bignums are restricted by the fixnum range
- we assume at least the presence of -1, possibly more
- we assume the widths of the IEEE representations (exponent and
  mantissa) are representable as fixnums

To use the code, fire up Scheme 48 in this directory, and do:

,config ,load packages.scm

Then do:

,in r6rs/will

or

,in r6rs/mike

to switch to an environment where Will's version or Mike's version of
the arithmetic is defined.

Note that you can't use the regular R5RS numbers here---you need to
convert them to the number representation of the reference
implementation via the procedure `r5rs->number'.  So, you might do
something like this:

r6rs/mike> (+ (r5rs->number 4) (r5rs->number 7))
#{Fx 11}

Enjoy!
