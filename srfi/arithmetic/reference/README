This is the reference implemenation of the Preliminary R6RS Arithmetic
SRFI.  The reference implementation itself probably has alpha quality,
and is a little rough around many of its edges.

See COPYING for license information.

It is written in R5RS Scheme  with few exceptions:

- There may be name clashes between the different modules that
  constitute the code.

- The fixnum code uses the underlying implementations of the bitwise
  operators; portable implementations are available as part of SRFI 60.

- The code uses SRFI 9 (Defining Record Types) and SRFI 23 (Error
  reporting mechanism).

- The code uses the Scheme 48 DEFINE-RECORD-DISCLOSER procedure to
  make the number objects print; these may be deleted without loss of
  functionality.

- Numerous modules assume an underlying IEEE-754-like representation
  for flonums; they are clearly marked in the module definitions as
  having dependencies on the FLONUMS-IEEE structure.

The code assumes a certain minimal fixnum range:

- The lengths of bignums are restricted by the fixnum range.
- We assume at least the presence of -1, possibly more.
- We assume the widths of the IEEE representations (exponent and
  mantissa) are representable as fixnums.
- Certain parts of the code also assume the fixnum range is
  essentially as in a two's complement representation; these should be
  easy to fix, however.

                                * * *

To load the code into an R5RS-conforming system:

1.  Enable SRFI 9 and SRFI 23.
2.  Disable any inlining of R5RS arithmetic procedures.
3.  (load "r5rs.sch")

This will run a series of tests after the code is loaded.

                                * * *

To load the code into Larceny, for example, just fire up larceny
in this directory, and do:

> (load "larceny.sch")
> (load "r5rs.sch")

After the tests have finished, you will have a read/eval/print
loop that uses this reference implementation for all arithmetic.

                                * * *

To use the code in Scheme48, fire up Scheme 48 in this directory, and do:

,config ,load packages.scm

Then do:

,in r6rs

to switch to an environment where the arithmetic is defined.

Note that you can't use the regular R5RS numbers here---you need to
convert them to the number representation of the reference
implementation via the procedure `r5rs->number'.  So, you might do
something like this:

r6rs> (+ (r5rs->number 4) (r5rs->number 7))
#{Fx 11}

To run the tests in Scheme48, do:

,config ,load packages.scm

Then do:

,in test-strings-to-numbers
,in test-generic-arithmetic
,in test-generic-arithmetic/mike
,in test-generic-arithmetic/exact
,in test-generic-arithmetic/inexact

                                * * *

Enjoy!
