Preliminary Proposal for R6RS Arithmetic

</strong>
</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Scheme's arithmetic system was designed to allow a wide variety
of implementations.  After many years of implementation experience,
however, most implementations now fall into a small number of
categories, and the benefits of continued experimentation no longer
justify the confusion and portability problems that have resulted
from giving implementations so much freedom in this area.
</p>

<p>
In addition, several details of the R5RS are inconsistent or
incomplete with respect to the IEEE standards for binary floating
point arithmetic, which are generally used to implement Scheme's
inexact real arithmetic.  Furthermore some details of the R5RS
make it unnecessarily difficult to implement Scheme's arithmetic
efficiently.
</p>

<p>
The portability problems can most easily be solved by requiring
all implementations to support the full numeric tower.  To
prevent that requirement from making Scheme substantially more
difficult to implement, we can provide reference implementations
that construct the full numeric tower from a fixnum/flonum base.
To ensure the portability of these reference implementations,
the fixnum/flonum base must be described and (at least partially)
standardized.
</p>

<p>
Fixnum/flonum arithmetic is already supported by many systems,
mainly for efficiency.  Standardization of fixnum/flonum
arithmetic would increase the portability of code that uses it,
but we cannot standardize the precision of fixnum/flonum arithmetic
without making it inefficient on some systems, which would defeat
its purpose.  We therefore propose to specify the syntax and much
of the semantics of fixnum/flonum arithmetic, but to make the
precision a parameter of the specification.
</p>

<p>
This SRFI proposes to revise section 6.2 ("Numbers") of R5RS by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>defining fixnum arithmetic (parameterized by precision)
<li>defining flonum arithmetic (inexactly)
<li>defining new procedures for performing exact arithmetic
<li>defining new procedures for performing inexact arithmetic
<li>describing the external representation and semantics of
    0.0, -0.0, +inf.0, -inf.0, +nan.0, and -nan.0 for systems
    that implement inexact real arithmetic using IEEE binary
    floating point
<li>changing the specification of <code>eqv?</code> to
    behave more sensibly with inexact numbers
<li>defining Scheme's real numbers to be the complex numbers
    whose imaginary part is an exact zero
<li>adding an external representation for inexact numbers
    that expresses the precision of a binary floating point
    representation
<li>restricting the domains of some R5RS procedures
<li>clarifying the semantics of some R5RS procedures
</ul>


<h2>Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>Instead of requiring the full numeric tower, the R6RS could
    require only the fixnum/flonum base, and make the full tower
    available as modules in the standard library.
<li>The main problem with banishing the full tower to a library
    is that <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, and several
    other procedures must know about the external representations
    of all numbers.
<li>Should a minimum precision be required for fixnums or flonums?
<li>Should the range of a fixnum be restricted to a power of two?
    To a two's complement range?
<li>Should the binary fixnum/flonums operations allow other than
    two arguments?
<li>What are the semantics of "safe mode" and "unsafe mode"?
    (This is a much larger question that the R6RS should address.)
<li>Should the R5RS procedures for generic arithmetic (e.g. <code>+</code>)
    remain in R6RS?  Here are five possible answers, phrased in
    terms of the <code>+</code> procedure:
    <ol>
    <li><code>+</code> is not defined in R6RS.
    <li><code>+</code> is defined to be a synonym for the <code>ex+</code>,
        so its domain is restricted to exact arguments, and always
        returns an exact result.
    <li><code>+</code> is defined as the union of the <code>ex+</code>
        and <code>in+</code> procedures, so all of its arguments are
        required to have the same exactness, and the exactness of its
        result is the same as the exactness of its arguments.
    <li><code>+</code> is defined as in R5RS, but with the increased
        portability provided by requiring the full numeric tower.
    <li><code>+</code> is defined to return an exact result in all
        cases, even if one or more of its arguments is inexact.
    </ol>
    Will Clinger prefers the 4th possibility, Mike Sperber the 5th.
    Members of the Scheme community should express themselves on this
    issue.
<li>The external representations of 0.0, -0.0, +inf.0, -inf.0, +nan.0,
    and -nan.0 must be specified.  The notations used here are used
    by several other languages, and have been adopted by several
    implementations of Scheme, but other notations are possible.
<li>The fixnum, flonum, and inexact arithmetic come with a full deck
    of operations, including some that are defined in terms of
    integers (such as <code>div+mod</code> and
    <code>quotient+remainder</code>), and others that are easily abused
    (such as <code>fxabs</code>).  Should these be pruned?
<li><strong>
    (FIXME: several more issues should go here)
    </strong>
</ul>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<strong>
(FIXME: most of the rationale is in the abstract)
</strong>

<p>
One of us (Sperber) has argued that Scheme's arithmetic requires
radical overhaul.  The other (Clinger) agrees that revisions are
needed.  This SRFI describes revisions that would satisfy both
of us.  Whether these revisions qualify as radical is best left
to the judgement of individual readers.
</p>

<p>
Most implementations of Scheme fall into
one of the following categories:
</p>
<ul>
<li>fixnums only (now rare except in toy implementations)
<li>fixnums and flonums only
<li>exact rationals and flonums only (no imaginary numbers)
<li>the complete numeric tower
</ul>
Under the R5RS, it is hard to write programs whose arithmetic
is portable across the above categories, and it is unnecessarily
difficult even to write programs whose arithmetic is portable
between different implementations in the same category.

<p>
Many of these portability problems could be made to disappear
by requiring implementations to support the complete numeric
tower, as in Common Lisp.
There has been concern that some implementors might ignore such
a requirement, giving us arithmetic that's portable in theory
but not in practice.
This proposal addresses that concern by defining fixnum and
flonum arithmetic with enough detail to support a portable
implementation of the complete numeric tower.
This approach recognizes the usefulness of fast fixnum/flonum
arithmetic, and fixes some of the things that have made it hard to
construct R5RS-compliant implementations with fast fixnum/flonum
arithmetic.
These changes should benefit both implementors and programmers.
</p>

<p>
This SRFI is incompatible with SRFI-70 in several ways, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>This SRFI defines a real number to be a complex number whose
    imaginary part is an exact zero.
<li>This SRFI regards +nan.0 as a real number whose value is so
    indeterminate that it might represent any real number within
    the closed interval [-inf.0,+inf.0].
</ul>
Both of the above differences are motivated by closure properties
that make it easier for an implementation to generate efficient
numerical code.

<p>
Moreover, unlike SRFI 70, this SRFI doesn't extend
<code>quotient</code>, <code>remainder</code>, and <code>modulo</code>
to real numbers, but instead provides additional operations
<code>div</code> and <code>mod</code>, which are slightly more
generally applicable and easier to specify.

<h2>Specification</h2>


<h3>External Representations</h3>

<p>
This SRFI adds the following external representations to Scheme:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>+inf.0</code> represents the result of
    <code>(/ 1.0 0.0)</code>
<li><code>-inf.0</code> represents the result of
    <code>(/ -1.0 0.0)</code>
<li><code>+nan.0</code> represents the result of
    <code>(/ 0.0 0.0)</code>, and may represent other NaNs as well.
    (This SRFI does not require read/write invariance for NaNs.)
<li>If <var>x</var> is an external representation of an inexact
    real number according to the R5RS, and <var>p</var> is a
    sequence of 1 or more decimal digits, then
    <var>x</var>|<var>p</var>
    is an external representation that denotes the
    best binary floating point approximation to <var>x</var>
    using a <var>p</var>-bit significand.
    For example, 1.1|53 is an external representation for the
    best approximation to 1.1 in IEEE double precision.
<li>If <var>x</var> is an external representation of an inexact
    real number according to the R5RS, then <var>x</var> by
    itself should be regarded as equivalent to
    <code><var>x</var>|53</code>.
</ul>

<p>
Implementations that use binary floating point representations
of real numbers should represent <var>x</var>|<var>p</var>
using a <var>p</var>-bit significand if practical, or by a greater
precision if a <var>p</var>-bit significand is not practical, or
by the largest available precision if <var>p</var> or more bits
of significand is not practical within the implementation.
</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<em>Note:</em>
The precision of a significand should not be confused with the
number of bits used to represent the significand.  In the IEEE
floating point standards, for example, the significand's most
significant bit is implicit in single and double precision but
is explicit in extended precision.  Whether that bit is implicit
or explicit does not affect the mathematical precision.
In implementations that use binary floating point, the default
precision can calculated by calling the following procedure:
</p>
<pre>
    (define (precision)
      (do ((n 0 (+ n 1))
           (x 1.0 (/ x 2.0)))
        ((= 1.0 (+ 1.0 x)) n)))
</pre>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<em>Note:</em>
When the underlying floating-point representation is IEEE double
precision, the |<var>p</var> suffix cannot be omitted for all cases:
Denormalized numbers have diminished precision, and therefore must
carry a |<var>p</var> suffix with the actual width of the signficand.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<p>
The <code>number-&gt;string</code> procedure should be generalized
to support the <var>x</var>|<var>p</var> notation.
<strong>(FIXME: details, please)</strong>
</p>

<p>
The <code>write</code> procedure should be required to write
inexact numbers in the external representation produced by
<code>number-&gt;string</code> with one argument.
</p>

<h3>Safe and Unsafe Mode</h3>

<p>
The SRFI uses the phrase "all bets are off" to describe that the
behavior of a procedure is unspecified for certain arguments in unsafe
mode.  Specifically, a procedure call for which all bets are off is
free to crash the system.
</p>

<h3><a name="integer-division">Integer Division</a></h3>

<P>
For various kinds of arithmetic (fixnum, flonum, exact, inexact, and
generic), this SRFI provides operations for performing integer
division.  Their variants differ mainly in the domains they operate
on, not in substance.  The following specification is of the general
variant.  Later section will link back to this one where appropriate.
</P>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>procedure:</U> <B>div+mod</B> <I>x1 x2</I>
<DT><U>library procedure:</U> <B>div</B> <I>x1 x2</I>
<DT><U>library procedure:</U> <B>mod</B> <I>x1 x2</I>
<DD>

These implement integer division and remainder on real numbers.  
<VAR>x2</VAR> should be non-zero. <B>div</B> returns an integer.

<PRE>
(div <VAR>x1</VAR> <VAR>x2</VAR>)                  ==&#62; <VAR>n_d</VAR>
(mod <VAR>x1</VAR> <VAR>x2</VAR>)                  ==&#62; <VAR>x_m</VAR>
</PRE>

where:
	<ol>
	  <li><VAR>x1</VAR> = <VAR>n_d</VAR> * <VAR>x2</VAR> +
	  <VAR>x_m</VAR>.</li>
	  <li>0 &lt;= <VAR>x_m</VAR> &lt; <VAR>x2</VAR> if <VAR>y</VAR>
	  &gt; 0</li>
	  <li><VAR>x2</VAR>/2 &lt;= <VAR>x_m</VAR> &lt;
	  -<VAR>x2</VAR>/2 if <VAR>x2</VAR> &lt; 0</li>
	</ol>
Moreover:
<PRE>
(div <VAR>x1</VAR> 0)                  ==&#62; 0
</PRE>	

</DD>
</DL>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>library procedure:</U> <B>quotient+remainder</B> <I>n1 n2</I>
<DT><U>library procedure:</U> <B>quotient</B> <I>n1 n2</I>
<DT><U>library procedure:</U> <B>remainder</B> <I>n1 n2</I>
<DT><U>library procedure:</U> <B>modulo</B> <I>n1 n2</I>
<DD>

<P>
These procedures implement number-theoretic (integer)
division.  <VAR>n2</VAR> should be non-zero.
All three procedures return integers.
<SAMP>`quotient'</SAMP>
returns an integer.  If <VAR>n1</VAR>/<VAR>n2</VAR> is an integer:

<PRE>
(quotient <VAR>n1</VAR> <VAR>n2</VAR>)                   ==&#62; <VAR>n1</VAR>/<VAR>n2</VAR>
(remainder <VAR>n1</VAR> <VAR>n2</VAR>)                  ==&#62; 0
(modulo <VAR>n1</VAR> <VAR>n2</VAR>)                     ==&#62; 0
</PRE>

If <VAR>n1</VAR>/<VAR>n2</VAR> is not an integer:

<PRE>
(quotient <VAR>n1</VAR> <VAR>n2</VAR>)                   ==&#62; <VAR>n_q</VAR>
(remainder <VAR>n1</VAR> <VAR>n2</VAR>)                  ==&#62; <VAR>n_r</VAR>
(modulo <VAR>n1</VAR> <VAR>n2</VAR>)                     ==&#62; <VAR>n_m</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
where <VAR>n_q</VAR> is <VAR>n1</VAR>/<VAR>n2</VAR> rounded towards zero,
0 &#60; |<VAR>n_r</VAR>| &#60; |<VAR>n2</VAR>|, 0 &#60; |<VAR>n_m</VAR>| &#60; |<VAR>n2</VAR>|,
<VAR>n_r</VAR> and <VAR>n_m</VAR> differ from <VAR>n1</VAR> by a multiple of <VAR>n2</VAR>,
<VAR>n_r</VAR> has the same sign as <VAR>n1</VAR>, and
<VAR>n_m</VAR> has the same sign as <VAR>n2</VAR>.

<P>
From this we can conclude that for integers <VAR>n1</VAR> and <VAR>n2</VAR> with
<VAR>n2</VAR> not equal to 0,

<PRE>
     (= <VAR>n1</VAR> (+ (* <VAR>n2</VAR> (quotient <VAR>n1</VAR> <VAR>n2</VAR>))
           (remainder <VAR>x1</VAR> <VAR>x2</VAR>)))
                                       ==&#62;  #t
</PRE>

provided all numbers involved in that computation are exact.


<PRE>
(quotient+remainder 13 4)              ==&#62;  3 1
(modulo 13 4)                          ==&#62;  1
(remainder 13 4)                       ==&#62;  1

(quotient+remainder -13 4)             ==&#62;  -3 -1
(modulo -13 4)                         ==&#62;  3
(remainder -13 4)                      ==&#62;  -1

<h3>Numerical Type Predicates</h3>

<font color=red>
The following description is a revised form of the description
given in SRFI-70.  Changes from SRFI-70 are highlighted in red.

<P>

<DT><U>procedure:</U> <B>number?</B> <I>obj</I>

<DD>
<DT><U>procedure:</U> <B>integer?</B> <I>obj</I>
<DD>


<P>
These numerical type predicates can be applied to any kind of
argument, including non-numbers.  They return <TT>#t</TT> if the object is
of the named type, and otherwise they return <TT>#f</TT>.
In general, if a type predicate is true of a number then all higher
type predicates are also true of that number.  Consequently, if a type
predicate is false of a number, then all lower type predicates are
also false of that number.


<p>
If <VAR>z</VAR> is
<font color=red>a <strike>inexact</strike></font> complex number, then
<SAMP>`(real? <VAR>z</VAR>)'</SAMP> is true if and only if
<SAMP>`(zero? (imag-part <VAR>z</VAR>))'</SAMP>
<font color=red>
and <SAMP>`(exact? (imag-part <VAR>z</VAR>))'</SAMP> are both true</font>.
</p>

<p>
<font color=red>
If <VAR>x</VAR> is a real number, then
<SAMP>`(rational? <VAR>z</VAR>)'</SAMP> is true if and only if
there exist exact integers <var>k1</var> and <var>k2</var>
such that
<SAMP>`(= <var>z</var> (/ <var>k1</var> <var>k2</var>))'</SAMP>
and
<SAMP>`(= (numerator <var>z</var>) <var>k1</var>)'</SAMP>
and
<SAMP>`(= (denominator <var>z</var>) <var>k2</var>)'</SAMP>
are all true.
Thus infinities and NaNs are not rational numbers.

<h3>Fixnums</h3>

<p>
Every implementation must define its fixnum range as a closed
interval [<var>lo</var>, <var>hi</var>] such that <var>lo</var>
and <var>hi</var> are (mathematical) integers with
<var>lo</var> &lt;= 0 &lt; 1 &lt;= <var>hi</var>.
Every mathematical integer within an implementation's fixnum
range must correspond to an exact integer that is representable
within the implementation.
The fixnum operations of an implementation will perform
arithmetic modulo <var>hi-lo+1</var>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Definition.</strong>
A fixnum is an exact integer whose value lies within the fixnum
range.
</p>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>procedure:</U> <B>fixnum?</B> <I>obj</I>

minimum and the maximum value of the fixnum range, respectively.
</DL>


<P>
We will use <var>fx</var>, <var>fx1</var> and <var>fx2</var> as metavariables
that range over fixnums.
</P>
<p>
If an argument to following procedures that corresponding to a fixnum
metavariable is not actually a fixnum, then these procedures signal an
error, unless the implementation is running in unsafe mode, in which
case all bets are off.

<h3>Flonums</h3>

<p>
<strong>Definition.</strong>
A flonum is an inexact real.
</p>

<p>
Please note that this definition does not imply any particular
representation for a flonum.  In particular, it does not imply
that flonums are represented by any kind of floating point
format.
</p>

<p>
We will use <var>fl1</var> and <var>fl2</var> as metavariables
that range over flonums.
</p>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>procedure:</U> <B>fl+</B> <I>fl1 fl2</I>
<DD>
<DT><U>procedure:</U> <B>fl-</B> <I>fl1 fl2</I>

<DT><U>procedure:</U> <B>fl*</B> <I>fl1 fl2</I>
<DD>
<DT><U>procedure:</U> <B>fl/</B> <I>fl1 fl2</I>
<DD>


<P>
These procedures return the inexact real sum, difference,
product, or quotient of their inexact real arguments.
In general, they should return the flonum that best
approximates the mathematical sum of their arguments.
(For implementations that represent flonums as IEEE
binary floating point numbers, the meaning of "best"
is reasonably well-defined by the IEEE standards.)
</P>

<p>
If either argument to these procedures is not actually
a flonum, then these procedures signal an error, unless
the implementation is running in unsafe mode, in which
case all bets are off.

<P>
These procedures return the same inexact real result that
would be returned by the R5RS procedures whose names
do not include the fl prefix.
In the event that the corresponding R5RS procedure does
not return a real result for the given arguments, the
result may be a NaN, or may be some meaningless inexact
real number.
Implementations that use IEEE binary floating point
arithmetic are encouraged to follow the relevant
standards for these procedures.
</P>

<p>
If the argument to these procedures is not actually
a flonum, then these procedures signal an error, unless

<h3>Conversions</h3>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>procedure:</U> <B>fixnum-&gt;flonum</B> <I>fx1</I>
<DD>
<DT><U>procedure:</U> <B>flonum-&gt;fixnum</B> <I>fl1</I>
<DD>

<p>
The <code>fixnum-&gt;flonum</code>
and <code>flonum-&gt;fixnum</code>
procedures provide for explicit conversions
between fixnums and flonums.
Programmers should understand that these procedures
cannot be expected to return results that are
numerically equal to their arguments.
</p>

<p>
For example, suppose the fixnum range is [-8388608,8388607]
and flonums are represented in IEEE double precision.  Then
</p>
<pre>
(fixnum-&gt;flonum 8388608)         =&gt; 8388608.0
(flonum-&gt;fixnum 3.14159265)      =&gt; 3
(flonum-&gt;fixnum -inf.0)          =&gt; -8388608
(flonum-&gt;fixnum 1e20)            =&gt; 8388607
</pre>

<p>
If the argument to these procedures is not actually
a flonum, then these procedures signal an error, unless
the implementation is running in unsafe mode, in which
case all bets are off.
</p>

<h3>
IEEE Binary Floating Arithmetic
</h3>

<p>
Although the R6RS should not require IEEE floating point arithmetic,
it should address certain specific issues of IEEE arithmetic.  In
particular, the R6RS should explain that
</p>
<pre>
    0.0
   -0.0
   +inf.0
   -inf.0
   +nan.0
</pre>
<p>
are likely to be distinct flonums.  The first two are inexact
rationals, but <code>+inf.0</code>, <code>-inf.0</code>, and
<code>+nan.0</code> are not rationals.
The R6RS should also explain that
</p>
<pre>
    (fl= 0.0 -0.0)                                =&gt;  #t
    (fl< -0.0 0.0)                                =&gt;  #f
    (fl= +nan.0 +nan.0)                           =&gt;  #f
</pre>
<p>
is required by the IEEE standards, and is strongly recommended
but not required by the R6RS.
</p>

<p>
The R6RS specification of eqv? should be changed so that
</p>
<pre>
    (eqv? -0.0 0.0)                             =&gt;  #f
</pre>
<p>
and to allow (but not require)
<code>(eqv? <var>x y</var>)</code> to evaluate to <code>#t</code>
when <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> are NaNs.
</p>

<p>
Note that <code>(negative? -0.0)</code> must return <code>#f</code>,
else it would lose the correspondence with
<code>(fl< -0.0 0.0)</code>, which is <code>#f</code>
according to the IEEE standards.
</p>
