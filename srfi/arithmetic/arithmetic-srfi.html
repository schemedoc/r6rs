   This SRFI is being submitted by members of the Scheme Language
   Editor's Committee as part of the R6RS Scheme standardization
   process.  The purpose of such ``R6RS SRFIs'' is to inform the
   Scheme community of features and design ideas under consideration
   by the editors and to allow the community to give the editors some
   direct feedback that will be considered during the design process.
</p>
<p>
   At the end of the discussion period, this SRFI will be withdrawn.
   When the R6RS specification is finalized, the SRFI may be revised
   to conform to the R6RS specification and then resubmitted with the
   intent to finalize it.  This procedure aims to avoid the situation
   where this SRFI is inconsistent with R6RS.  An inconsistency
   between R6RS and this SRFI could confuse some users.  Moreover it
   could pose implementation problems for R6RS compliant Scheme
   systems that aim to support this SRFI.  Note that departures from
   the SRFI specification by the Scheme Language Editor's Committee
   may occur due to other design constraints, such as design
   consistency with other features that are not under discussion as
   SRFIs.

<h1><a name="Abstract">Abstract</a></h1>

<p>
Scheme's arithmetic system was designed to allow a wide variety of
implementations.  After many years of implementation experience,
however, most implementations now fall into a small number of
categories, and the benefits of continued experimentation no longer
justify the confusion and portability problems that have resulted from
giving implementations so much freedom in this area.  Moreover, the
R5RS generic arithmetic is difficult to implement as efficiently as
purely fixnum or purely flonum arithmetic.  (Fixnum arithmetic is
typically limited-precision integer arithmetic implemented using the
underlying machine's representation; flonum arithmetic is typically
limited-precision floating-point arithmetic using the underlying
machine's representation.)

<P>
This SRFI is an effort to extend and clarify the R5RS arithmetic to
make it more portable, more comprehensive, and enable faster programs.

<P>
Furthermore, one of us (Sperber) has argued that Scheme's arithmetic
requires radical overhaul.  The other (Clinger) agrees that revisions
are needed.  This SRFI describes revisions that would satisfy both of
us and states the choice between both of them as an issue to be
resolved in the discussion period of this SRFI.  Whether these
revisions qualify as radical is best left to the judgement of
individual readers.

<p>
This SRFI proposes to revise section 6.2 ("Numbers") of R5RS by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>requiring a Scheme implementation to provide the full tower,
    including exact rationals of arbitrary precision, exact
    rectangular complex numbers with rational real and imaginary
    parts, and inexact real and complex arithmetic
<li>defining fixnum arithmetic (parameterized by precision)
<li>defining flonum arithmetic (inexactly)
<li>defining new procedures for performing exact arithmetic
<li>defining new procedures for performing inexact arithmetic
<li>describing the external representation and semantics of
    0.0, -0.0, infinities and NaNs for systems
    that implement inexact real arithmetic using IEEE binary
    floating point
<li>changing the specification of <code>eqv?</code> to
    behave more sensibly with inexact numbers
<li>defining Scheme's real numbers to be the complex numbers
    whose imaginary part is an exact zero
<li>adding an external representation for inexact numbers
    that expresses the precision of a binary floating point
    representation
<li>defining procedures for some new operations, including integer
    division and bitwise operations
    remainder on real numbers, 
<li>restricting the domains of some R5RS procedures
<li>clarifying the semantics of some R5RS procedures
<li>possibly changing the semantics of some R5RS procedures
</ul>


<h1><a name="Issues">Issues</a></h1>

<P>
Members of the Scheme community are encouraged to express themselves
on the following issues:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Instead of requiring the full numeric tower, R6RS could
    require only the fixnum/flonum base, and make the full tower
    available as modules in the standard library.
<li>The main problem with banishing the full tower to a library
    is that <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, and several
    other procedures must know about the external representations
    of all numbers.
<li>Should a minimum precision be required for fixnums or flonums?
<li>Should the range of a fixnum be restricted to a power of two?
    To a two's complement range?
<li>The fixnum operations provide efficient fixnums that "wrap."
    However, they do not give efficient access to the hardware facilities
    for carry and overflow.  This would be desirable to implement
    efficient generic arithmetic on fixnums portably.  On the other hand,
    there isn't much experience with formulating a portable interface to these
    facilities.
<li>
  The fixnum operators wrap on overflow, i.e., they perform modular
  arithmetic.  For many purposes, it would be better
  for them to signal an error in safe mode.  Since the modulus is
  implementation-dependent, portable code cannot generally take advantage
  of the wrapping.  Instead, applications are likely to use fixnums simply
  to avoid the overhead of generic arithmetic under the assumption that
  all quantities computed fit in the fixnum range, and feedback if this
  turns out not to be the case will be valuable.  On the other hand,
  the wrapping semantics can also be useful, i.e., in the coding of a
  practical implementation of bignums in terms of fixnums.  It may be
  that we should consider including two sets of operators: <code>fx</code> operators
  that signal an error upon overflow and <code>wfx</code> operators that wrap.
<li>Should the binary fixnum/flonum operations allow other than
    two arguments?
<li>What are the semantics of "safe mode" and "unsafe mode"?
    (This is a much larger question that R6RS should address.)
<li>Should R6RS allow other inexact reals beside the flonums?
    This draft does allow them, at the cost of some complications and
    additions such as <code>real-&gt;flonum</code>.
    (See the <a href="#design-rationale">Design Rationale</a>.)
<li>Should the R5RS procedures for generic arithmetic (e.g. <code>+</code>)
    remain in R6RS?  Here are five possible answers, phrased in
    terms of the <code>+</code> procedure:
    <ol>
    <li><code>+</code> is not defined in R6RS.
    <li><code>+</code> is defined to be a synonym for the <code>ex+</code>,
        so its domain is restricted to exact arguments, and always
        returns an exact result.
    <li><code>+</code> is defined as the union of the <code>ex+</code>
        and <code>in+</code> procedures, so all of its arguments are
        required to have the same exactness, and the exactness of its
        result is the same as the exactness of its arguments.
    <li><code>+</code> is defined as in R5RS, but with the increased
        portability provided by requiring the full numeric tower.
        This alternative is described in the section 
	<a href="#r5rs-generic">R5RS-style Generic Arithmetic</a>.
    <li><code>+</code> is defined to return an exact result in all
        cases, even if one or more of its arguments is inexact.
        This alternative is described in the section 
	<a href="#exact-generic">Generic Exact Arithmetic</a>.
    </ol>
    Will Clinger prefers the 4th possibility, Mike Sperber the 5th.
<li>If R6RS does not adopt a R5RS-style model for the generic arithmetic,
    should it still provide more R5RS-compatible generic arithmetic as
    a library?
<li>The external representations of 0.0, -0.0, infinities and NaNs
    must be specified.  The notations used here are used
    by several other languages, and have been adopted by several
    implementations of Scheme, but other notations are possible.
<li>The fixnum, flonum, and inexact arithmetic come with a full deck
    of operations, including some that are defined in terms of
    integers (such as 
    <code>quotient+remainder</code>, <code>gcd</code> and <code>lcm</code>), and others that are easily abused
    (such as <code>fxabs</code>).  Should these be pruned?
<li>The R5RS says this:
<blockquote>
<P>
<EM>Rationale:</EM>
<CODE>Magnitude</CODE> is the same as <CODE>abs</CODE> for a real argument,
but <CODE>abs</CODE> must be present in all implementations, whereas
<CODE>magnitude</CODE> need only be present in implementations that support
general complex numbers.
</blockquote>
    Given that this SRFI suggests requiring all implementations to
    support the general complex numbers, should <code>abs</code> (and
    <code>exabs</code> and <code>inabs</code>) be removed?
<li>The <code>real?</code>, <code>rational?</code>, and <code>integer?</code> predicates must
    return false for complex numbers with an imaginary part
    of inexact zero, as non-realness is now contagious.
    This causes possibly unexpected behavior: <SAMP>`(zero?
    0+0.0i)'</SAMP> returns true despite <SAMP>`(integer?
    0+0.0i)'</SAMP> returning false.
    Possibly, new predicates <code>realistic?</code>,
    <code>rationalistic?</code>, and <code>integral?</code> should be
    added to say that a number can be coerced to the specified type
    (and back) without loss.
    (See the <a href="#design-rationale">Design Rationale</a>.)
<li>Most Scheme implementations represent an inexact complex number as
    a pair of two inexact reals, representing the real and imaginary
    parts of the number, respectively.  Should R6RS mandate the
    presence of such a representation (while allowing additional
    alternative representations), thus allowing it to more
    meaningfully discuss semantic issues such as branch cuts?
<li>The <code>x|53</code> default for the mantissa width discriminates
against implementations that default to unusually good representations,
such as IEEE extended precision.  Are there any such implementations?
Do we expect such implementations in the near future?
<li>Should `<code>(floor +inf.0)</code>' return <code>+inf.0</code> or
    signal an error instead?  (Similarly for <code>ceiling</code>,
    <code>flfloor</code>, <code>infloor</code>, etc.)
<li>The bitwise operations operate on exact integers only.  Should
    they live in the section on exact arithmetic?  Should they carry
    <code>ex</code> prefixes?  Or should they be extended to work
    on inexact integers as well?
<li>The division between regular procedures and library procedures is
    somewhat arbitrary.
</ul>

<h1><a name="Rationale">Rationale</a></h1>

<p>
Most implementations of Scheme fall into
one of the following categories:
</p>
<ul>
<li>fixnums only (now rare except in toy implementations)
<li>fixnums and flonums only
<li>exact rationals and flonums only (no imaginary numbers)
<li>the complete numeric tower
</ul>
Under R5RS, it is hard to write programs whose arithmetic
is portable across the above categories, and it is unnecessarily
difficult even to write programs whose arithmetic is portable
between different implementations in the same category.

<p>
The portability problems can most easily be solved by requiring
all implementations to support the full numeric tower.  To
prevent that requirement from making Scheme substantially more
difficult to implement, we provide a reference implementation
that constructs the full numeric tower from a fixnum/flonum base.
To ensure the portability of such reference implementations,
the fixnum/flonum base must be described and (at least partially)
standardized.
</p>

<p>
Fixnum/flonum arithmetic is already supported by many systems,
mainly for efficiency.  Standardization of fixnum/flonum
arithmetic would increase the portability of code that uses it,
but we cannot standardize the precision of fixnum/flonum arithmetic
without making it inefficient on some systems, which would defeat
its purpose.  We therefore propose to specify the syntax and much
of the semantics of fixnum/flonum arithmetic, but to make the
precision a parameter of the specification.
</p>

<p>
Several details of R5RS are inconsistent or incomplete with
respect to the IEEE standards for binary floating point arithmetic,
which are generally used to implement Scheme's inexact real
arithmetic.  Furthermore, some details of R5RS make it
unnecessarily difficult to implement Scheme's arithmetic efficiently.
</p>

<P>
This SRFI is incompatible with <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-70/">SRFI 70</a> 
<a href="#jaffer-2005">[Jaffer 2005]</a> in several ways, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>This SRFI defines a real number to be a complex number whose
    imaginary part is an exact zero.  (See the <a
    href="#design-rationale">Design Rationale</a> for a discussion.)
<li>This SRFI regards <code>+nan.0</code> as a real number whose value is so
    indeterminate that it might represent any real number within
    the closed interval [<code>-inf.0</code>,<code>+inf.0</code>].
</ul>
Both of the above differences are motivated by <a
href="#ComplexIssuesClosureProperties">closure properties</a> that
make it easier for an implementation to generate efficient numerical
code.

<p>
Moreover, unlike SRFI 70, this SRFI doesn't extend
<code>quotient</code>, <code>remainder</code>, and <code>modulo</code>
to real numbers, but instead provides additional operations
<code>div</code> and <code>mod</code>, which are slightly more
generally applicable and easier to specify.  It also does not extend
the <code>gcd</code> and <code>lcm</code> to rational numbers.  

<P>
The sections on <a href="#Fixnums">Fixnums</a>, <a
href="#Flonums">Flonums</a>, <a href="#exact">Exact Arithmetic</a>,
and <a href="#inexact">Inexact Arithmetic</a> are new in the SRFI and
not in SRFI 70.  Moreover, the section <a
href="#exact-generic">Generic Exact Arithmetic</a> is also new here.
This SRFI also omits SRFI 70's discussion of infinities and offers its
own.

<P>
Other, more minor differences with SRFI 70 are highlighted in the
hypertext.  (The sections mentioned in the previous paragraph are not
marked up, as they would be (almost in the case of generic exact
arithmetic) completely red.

<P>
This SRFI describes several alternative approaches to completely
generic arithmetic.  The alternative described in the section <a
href="#r5rs-generic">R5RS-style Generic Arithmetic</a> follows the
essence of R5RS, with the advantage of historical continuity and
contagiousness of inexact operations.  The alternative described in
section <a href="#exact-generic">Generic Exact Arithmetic</a> has
exactness be contagious, with the advantage of greater transparency
and the validity of standard algebraic laws
over the R5RS-style generic arithmetic.  The section describing
generic exact
arithmetic opens with a more detailed rationale.  Other alternatives
build on the exact arithmetic described in section <a href="#exact">Exact Arithmetic</a>
and the inexact arithmetic described in section <a href="#inexact">Inexact Arithmetic</a>.


<h1><a name="Specification">Specification</a></h1>

<P>
We assume that Section 6.2.3 ("Implementation restrictions") of R5RS
remains essentially as it stands.  The text of this SRFI describes the
differences between the proposed additions and changes to R5RS and/or
SRFI 70.

<h2><a name="ExternalRepresentations">External Representations</a></h2>

<p>
This SRFI adds the following external representations to Scheme:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>+inf.0</code> represents the result of
    <code>(/ 1.0 0.0)</code>
<li><code>-inf.0</code> represents the result of
    <code>(/ -1.0 0.0)</code>
<li><code>+nan.0</code> represents the result of
    <code>(/ 0.0 0.0)</code>, and may represent other NaNs as well.
    (This SRFI does not require read/write invariance for NaNs.)
<li>If <var>x</var> is an external representation of an inexact
    real number according to R5RS, and <var>p</var> is a
    sequence of 1 or more decimal digits, then
    <var>x</var><code>|</code><var>p</var>
    is an external representation that denotes the
    best binary floating point approximation to <var>x</var>
    using a <var>p</var>-bit significand.
    For example, <code>1.1|53</code> is an external representation for the
    best approximation to 1.1 in IEEE double precision.
<li>If <var>x</var> is an external representation of an inexact
    real number according to R5RS, then <var>x</var> by
    itself should be regarded as equivalent to
    <code><var>x</var><code>|</code>53</code>.
</ul>

<p>
Implementations that use binary floating point representations
of real numbers should represent <var>x</var><code>|</code><var>p</var>
using a <var>p</var>-bit significand if practical, or by a greater
precision if a <var>p</var>-bit significand is not practical, or
by the largest available precision if <var>p</var> or more bits
of significand is not practical within the implementation.
</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<em>Note:</em>
The precision of a significand should not be confused with the
number of bits used to represent the significand.  In the IEEE
floating point standards, for example, the significand's most
significant bit is implicit in single and double precision but
is explicit in extended precision.  Whether that bit is implicit
or explicit does not affect the mathematical precision.
In implementations that use binary floating point, the default
precision can be calculated by calling the following procedure:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
    (define (precision)
      (do ((n 0 (+ n 1))
           (x 1.0 (/ x 2.0)))
        ((= 1.0 (+ 1.0 x)) n)))
</pre>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<em>Note:</em>
When the underlying floating-point representation is IEEE double
precision, the <code>|</code><var>p</var> suffix should not be omitted for all cases:
Denormalized numbers have diminished precision, and therefore should
carry a <code>|</code><var>p</var> suffix with the actual width of the signficand.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
The <code>number-&gt;string</code> procedure is generalized
over the R5RS version
to support the <var>x</var><code>|</code><var>p</var> notation.
</p>

<p>
To be consistent with this SRFI,
the <code>write</code> procedure would be required to write
inexact numbers in the external representation produced by
<code>number-&gt;string</code> with one argument.
</p>

<p>
    Implementations are not required to use floating-point
    representations, but every implementation is required to
    designate a subset of its inexact reals as flonums, and
    to convert certain external representations into flonums.
</p>

<P>The R6RS section on the lexical structure of numerical tokens should read as as
follows:

    If a <code>&lt;decimal 10&gt;</code> does not contain a non-empty <code>&lt;mantissa width&gt;</code>
    and does not contain one of the exponent markers <code>s</code>, <code>f</code>, <code>d</code>, or <code>l</code>,

    it is an external representation for a flonum.
    Furthermore <code>inf.0</code>, <code>+inf.0</code>, <code>-inf.0</code>, <code>nan.0</code>, <code>+nan.0</code>, and <code>-nan.0</code> are

<h2><a name="SafeUnsafeMode">Safe and Unsafe Mode</a></h2>

<P>
This SRFI allows a Scheme implementation to run code in one of two global
modes: "safe" and "unsafe" mode.  These affect the fixnum and the
flonum operations.  In safe mode, these operations must check that
their arguments are actually fixnums or flonums respectively, or
perform possible additional checking as required by the specifications
of the operations.  In unsafe mode, these operations must provide no
such checking.  This distinction allows an implementation to generate
efficient numerical code at the cost of avoiding run-time checking.
The R6RS should require a Scheme implementation to provide the safe
mode.

<p>
This SRFI uses the phrase "all bets are off" to describe that the
behavior of a procedure is unspecified for certain arguments in unsafe
mode.  Specifically, a procedure call for which all bets are off is
free to crash the system.

<h2><a name="EquivalenceOfObjects">Equivalence of Objects</a></h2>

<p>
    The R6RS specification of eqv? for numbers should be changed
    as follows.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>eqv?</code> procedure returns <code>#t</code> if:

<ul>
<li> <var>obj1</var> and <var>obj2</var> are both exact numbers, and are numerically
          equal (see <code>=</code>, section see section 6.2
          Numbers).</li>
<li>
    <var>obj1</var> and <var>obj2</var> are both inexact numbers, are numerically
          equal (see <code>=</code>, section see section 6.2 Numbers), and
          yield the same results (in the sense of <code>eqv?</code>) when passed
          as arguments to any other procedure that can be defined
          as a finite composition of Scheme's standard arithmetic
          procedures.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The <code>eqv?</code> procedure returns <code>#f</code> if:
</p>

<ul>
<li> one of <var>obj1</var> and <var>obj2</var> is an exact number but the other is
	an inexact number. </li>
<li><var>obj1</var> and <var>obj2</var> are numbers for which the <code>=</code> procedure
 returns <code>#f</code>. </li>
<li><var>obj1</var> and <var>obj2</var> yield different results (in the sense of
	<code>eqv?</code>) when passed as arguments to any other procedure
          that can be defined as a finite composition of Scheme's
          standard arithmetic procedures.

<P>
These numerical type predicates can be applied to any kind of
argument, including non-numbers.  They return <TT>#t</TT> if the object is
of the named type, and otherwise they return <TT>#f</TT>.
In general, if a type predicate is true of a number then all higher
type predicates are also true of that number.  Consequently, if a type
predicate is false of a number, then all lower type predicates are
also false of that number.

<h2><a name="Fixnums">Fixnums</a></h2>

<p>
A subset range of the exact integers is denoted as the set of fixnums.
Conversely, a fixnum is an exact integer whose value lies within this
fixnum range.
</p>

<p>
Every implementation must define its fixnum range as a closed
interval [<var>lo</var>, <var>hi</var>] such that <var>lo</var>
and <var>hi</var> are (mathematical) integers with
<var>lo</var> &lt;= 0 &lt; 1 &lt;= <var>hi</var>.
Every mathematical integer within an implementation's fixnum
range must correspond to an exact integer that is representable
within the implementation.
The fixnum operations of an implementation will perform
arithmetic modulo <var>hi-lo+1</var>.

<DT><U>procedure:</U> <CODE>flonum-&gt;fixnum</CODE> <var>fl</var>
<DD>

<p>
The <code>fixnum-&gt;flonum</code>
and <code>flonum-&gt;fixnum</code>
procedures provide for explicit conversions
between fixnums and flonums.  The <code>fixnum-&gt;flonum</code>
procedure returns, for a flonum argument, its numerically closest
fixnum.
The <code>flonum-&gt;fixnum</code>
procedure returns, for a fixnum argument, its numerically closest
flonum.
Programmers should understand that these procedures
cannot be expected to return results that are
numerically equal to their arguments.
</p>

<p>
For example, suppose the fixnum range is [-8388608,8388607]
and flonums are represented in IEEE double precision.  Then
</p>
<pre>
(fixnum-&gt;flonum 8388608)         ==&gt; 8388608.0
(flonum-&gt;fixnum 3.14159265)      ==&gt; 3

(flonum-&gt;fixnum 1e20)            ==&gt; 8388607
</pre>

<p>
If the argument to <code>fixnum-&gt;flonum</code> is not a fixnum, or
the argument to <code>flonum-&gt;fixnum</code> is NaN or not a flonum,
then an error is signalled, unless the implementation is
running in unsafe mode, in which case all bets are off.

<h2><a name="exact">Exact Arithmetic</A></h2>

The exact arithmetic provides generic operations on exact numbers;
these operations correspond to their mathematical counterparts.  The
exact numbers include rationals of arbitrary precision, and exact
rectangular complex numbers.  A rational number with a denominator of
1 is indistinguishable from its numerator.  An exact rectangular
complex number with a zero imaginary part is indistinguishable from
its real part.

also false of that number.

<h2><a name="r5rs-generic">R5RS-style Generic Arithmetic</a></h2>

<P>In this model of arithmetic, the section on exactness reads as follows:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Scheme numbers are either <I>exact</I> or <I>inexact</I>.  A number is
exact if it was written as an exact constant or was derived from exact
numbers using only exact operations.  A number is inexact if it <FONT
COLOR=red><STRIKE>is infinite, if it </STRIKE></FONT>was written as an
inexact constant, if it was derived using inexact ingredients, or if
it was derived using inexact operations. <FONT COLOR=red>The generic
operations all implement inexact operations.</FONT>  Thus inexactness
is a contagious property of a number.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="red"><STRIKE>Each exact number corresponds to a single mathematical number.  It is
the programmer's responsibility to avoid using exact numbers with
magnitude or precision too large to be represented in the
implementation.
For inexact numbers,
it is the programmer's responsibility to
avoid using
complex numbers with magnitude too large to be
represented in the implementation.</STRIKE></FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="red">It is the programmer's responsibility to avoid using
numbers with magnitude or significant too large to be represented in
the implementation.</font>


<P>
If two implementations produce exact results for a computation 
that did not involve inexact intermediate results <FONT COLOR="red">or the
results of numerical predicates</FONT>, the two ultimate results will be
mathematically equivalent.  This is generally not true of computations
involving inexact numbers because approximate methods such as floating
point arithmetic may be used, but it is the duty of each
implementation to make the result as close as practical to the
mathematically ideal result.

<P>
Rational operations such as <CODE>+</CODE> should always produce
exact results when given exact arguments.
<FONT COLOR=red><STRIKE>If the operation is unable to produce an exact result,
then it may either report the violation of an implementation restriction
or it may silently coerce its
result to an inexact value.
See section 6.2.3.
</STRIKE></FONT>

<P>
With the exception of <CODE>inexact-&#62;exact</CODE>
<FONT COLOR="red"><STRIKE><code>exact-round</code>, <code>exact-ceiling</code>,
<code>exact-floor</code>, and <code>exact-truncate</code></STRIKE></FONT>,
the operations
described in this section must
return inexact results when given any inexact arguments.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The procedures described here behave
consistently with the inexact arithmetic if passed inexact
arguments, and
consistently with the exact arithmetic if passed exact
arguments.

<p>
We will use <var>z</var>, <var>z1</var>, <var>z2</var>, and
<var>z3</var> as metavariables that range over the complex numbers,

metavariables that range over the inexact integers.

<P>
<CODE>Rationalize</CODE> returns the <EM>simplest</EM> rational number
differing from <VAR>x</VAR> by no more than <VAR>y</VAR>.  A rational number r<span class=sub>1</span> is
<EM>simpler</EM>  than another rational number

r<span class=sub>2</span> if r<span class=sub>1</span> = p<span class=sub>1</span>/q<span class=sub>1</span> and r<span class=sub>2</span> = p<span class=sub>2</span>/q<span class=sub>2</span> 
(in lowest terms) and |p<span class=sub>1</span>|&lt;= |p<span class=sub>2</span>| and |q<span class=sub>1</span>| &lt;= |q<span class=sub>2</span>|.
Thus 3/5 is simpler than 4/7.
Although not all rationals are comparable in this ordering (consider 2/7
and 3/5) any interval contains a rational number that is simpler than
every other rational number in that interval (the simpler 2/5 lies
between 2/7 and 3/5).  Note that 0 = 0/1 is the simplest rational of
all.

<h2><a name="exact-generic">Generic Exact Arithmetic</a></h2>

<p>This specification of exact arithmetic is an alternative to the
R5RS-style generic arithmetic described in the previous section.


<p>
The exact generic arithmetic provides generic operations on exact and
inexact rational and complex numbers.  Each inexact number, except for
infinities and NaNs and complex numbers with infinite or NaN real or
imaginary part, is taken to represent a unique exact rational
number or exact complex number with exact rational real and imaginary
parts, namely the one produced by <code>inexact-&gt;exact</code>.
With this provision, the generic exact operations correspond to their
mathematical counterparts.  
</p>

<P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE><em>Note:</em> In this section, changes with respect SRFI 70
aren't marked specially---otherwise, the entire section would be in
red.
    </blockquote>

<P>In this model of arithmetic, the section on exactness reads as follows:
<font color=red>
Changes from the description of exactness in the previous section are
highlighted in red.
</font>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Scheme numbers are either <I>exact</I> or <I>inexact</I>.  A number is
exact if it was written as an exact constant or was derived from exact
numbers using only exact operations.  A number is inexact if it was
written as an inexact constant, if it was derived using inexact
ingredients, or if it was derived using inexact operations.  The
generic operations all implement <FONT
color="red"><strike>inexact</strike> exact</FONT> operations.
Consequently, <FONT color="red"><strike>inexactness</strike>
exactness</FONT> is a contagious property of a number.

<P>
It is the programmer's responsibility to avoid using
numbers with magnitude or significand too large to be represented in
the implementation.

<P>
If two implementations produce exact results for a computation <FONT
COLOR="red">using only the operations described in this section</FONT>
that did not involve inexact <FONT COLOR="red"><STRIKE>intermediate
results or the results of numerical predicates</STRIKE></FONT> inputs
<FONT COLOR=red>(which include the literals representing inexact
numbers)</FONT>, the two ultimate results will be mathematically
equivalent.  <FONT COLOR="red"><STRIKE>This is generally not true of
computations involving inexact numbers because approximate methods
such as floating point arithmetic may be used, but it is the duty of
each implementation to make the result as close as practical to the
mathematically ideal result.</STRIKE> </FONT>

<FONT COLOR="red">
The transition from exactness to inexactness is always explicit
through <code>exact-&gt;inexact</code>, <code>real-&gt;flonum</code>
(or indirectly through I/O).  Consequently, inexactness cannot
implicitly contaminate a computation that started out with exact
numbers and does not use the (explicitly) inexact operations.
</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR=red><STRIKE>
Rational operations such as <CODE>+</CODE> should always produce
exact results when given exact arguments.
If the operation is unable to produce an exact result,
then it may either report the violation of an implementation restriction
or it may silently coerce its
result to an inexact value.
See section 6.2.3.
</STRIKE></FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR=red><STRIKE>
With the exception of <CODE>exact-&#62;inexact</CODE>
the operations
described in this section must
return inexact results when given any inexact arguments.
</STRIKE></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Rationale:</EM> This departure from the R5RS semantics abandons
the notion that the same program may compute either exactly or inexactly,
depending on the input numbers.  Each generic procedure always
performs the same computation, which is in contrast to R5RS where the
generic procedures perform different operations depending on their
inputs.  This means that the generic operations reliably fulfill the
standard algebraic laws.  For a more detailed treatment of the
subject, refer to the paper by Egner et al. <A
href="#egner-at-al-2004">[Egner et al. 2004]</A>.

<h1><a name="design-rationale">Design Rationale</a></h1>

<p>
Background and Rationale
concerning two issues of R6RS arithmetic
(written by William D Clinger, 29 July 2005)

<p>
(Most experts who read this note will want to start with the section
<a href="#ComplexIssuesFlowAnalysisProblems">Problems With Flow
Analysis</a>, thereby skipping the history and background information
that is intended to make this note more self-contained and
accessible.)


<h2><a name="LuciersProposal">Lucier's Proposal</a></h2>

<P>
In 1998, for the Scheme workshop before ICFP '98 in Baltimore,
Brad Lucier proposed several changes that were intended to
bring Scheme's inexact arithmetic into line with the IEEE
floating point standards and with other recommended practice
for transcendental functions and complex arithmetic.  Most of
Lucier's proposals would have applied only to implementations
that use IEEE floating point for inexact arithmetic, and would
thus act as recommendations, much like the appendices on inexact
arithmetic that were published with the IEEE standard for Scheme.
A few of Lucier's proposals would have required changes to the
Scheme standards themselves, however.
</P>

<P>
Few of the workshop attendees knew enough about the IEEE floating
point standards to discuss Lucier's proposal.  A straw poll was
taken, and came out 31-0 in favor of bringing Scheme into line
with IEEE floating point and with current practice, trusting
experts to work out the details.
</P>

<P>
Here are the highlights of Lucier's proposal, taken verbatim from
my notes on the 1998 workshop:
</P>

<blockquote>
<P>
    The behavior of <code>eqv?</code> on inexact numbers would change.
    If <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> are inexact reals represented as IEEE floating
    point numbers, then <code>`(eqv? <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)'</code> would be true if and only if
    <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> are equal <em>and</em> have the same base, sign, number of
    bits in the exponent, number of bits in the significand,
    and the same biased exponents and significands.  For
    example, <code>`(eqv? +0. -0.)</code> would be false, as would
    <code>`(eqv? 1e8 1d8)'</code> in an implementation for which <code>1d8</code> has more
    precision than <code>1e8</code>.  In most implementations <code>`(eqv? <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)'</code>
    would be computed by a bit-level comparison of the floating
    point representations for <var>x</var> and <var>y</var>.
</P>

<P>
    <code>`(real? 4.3+0.i)'</code> and <code>`(real? 4.3-0.i)'</code> would be false, although
    <code>`(real? 4.3+0i)'</code> and <code>`(real? 4.3-0i)'</code> would remain true (assuming
    an implementation allows the real and imaginary parts of a
    complex number to have a different exactness, which is not
    required by the Scheme standards and would not be required
    by Lucier's proposal).
</P>

<P>
    <code>Truncate</code>, <code>round</code>, <code>ceiling</code>, and <code>floor</code> would be defined only on
    rationals, not on all reals.  The motivation for this is that
    infinities and NaNs would be reals but not rationals, and
    there is no meaningful integer value that these procedures
    could return for infinities and NaNs.  Similarly the first
    argument to <code>rationalize</code> would be required to be a rational.
</P>

<P>
    The branch cuts for certain transcendental functions would
    change to conform to current practice.
</P>

<P>
    Kahan reportedly would like for <code>`(max 1 +nan.0 2)'</code> to return 2
    instead of <code>+nan.0</code>, but this would conflict with the guiding
    principle of Scheme's inexact arithmetic so I oppose this.
    Returning an inexact <code>2.0</code> would be consistent with Scheme's
    arithmetic, and would not require any changes to the Scheme
    standards.
</P>
</blockquote>


<h2><a name="ComplexIssues">The Issues</a></h2>

<P>
The purpose of this note is to explain why it is desirable for
Scheme's reals to have an exact zero as their imaginary part.

<P>
This note also discusses whether the proposed "flonum" type
should be a synonym for "inexact real", or merely a subset
of the inexact reals.

<h3><a name="ComplexIssuesNumericalTypes">Numerical Types</a></h3>

<P>
Scheme's numerical types are the exactness types { exact, inexact },
the tower types { integer, rational, real, complex, number }, and
the Cartesian product of the exactness types with the tower types,
where &lt; t1, t2 &gt; is regarded as a subtype of both t1 and t2.

<P>
These types have an aesthetic symmetry to them, but they are not
equally important.  Judging by the number of R5RS procedures whose
domain is restricted to values of some numerical type, the most
important numerical types are the exact integers, the integers,
the rationals, the reals, and the complex numbers.

<P>
Many programmers and implementors regard R5RS's focus on those
particular numerical types as something of a mistake.  In practice,
there is reason to believe that the most important numerical types
are the exact integers, the exact rationals, the inexact reals, and
the inexact complex numbers.  The following section explores one of
the reasons those four types are so important in practice.


<h3><a name="ComplexIssuesClosureProperties">Closure Properties</a></h3>

<P>
Scheme's types are not completely arbitrary.  Each type corresponds
to a set of values that turns up repeatedly as the natural domain
or range of the functions that are computed by Scheme's standard
procedures.  The reason these types turn up so often is that they
are closed under certain sets of operations.

<P>
The exact integers, for example, are closed under the integral
operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication.  The
exact rationals are closed under the rational operations, which
consist of the integral operations plus division (although we
must make a special case for division by zero).  The reals (and
inexact reals) are closed under some (often inexact) interpretation
of rational and irrational operations such as exp and sin, but are
not closed under operations such as <code>log</code>, <code>sqrt</code>, and <code>expt</code>.  The complex
(and inexact complex) numbers are closed under the largest set
of operations.

<h3><a name="ComplexIssuesRepresentationTypes">Representation Types</a></h3>

<P>
The Scheme standards give implementations considerable freedom
with respect to the representation of expressed values, but the
usual approach is to represent the numerical types as unions of
the representation types that appear on the right hand sides of
the following domain equations:

<P>
<table>
<tr>
    <td>exact integer</td>  <td>=</td> <td>fixnum + bignum</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>exact rational</td> <td>=</td><td> fixnum + bignum + ratnum</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>inexact real</td>    <td>=</td>  <td>flonum</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>inexact complex</td> <td>=</td>  <td>flonum + compnum</td>
</tr>
<tr>

    <td>integer</td>         <td>=</td>  <td>fixnum + bignum + subset of flonum</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>rational</td>        <td>=</td>  <td>fixnum + bignum + ratnum + subset of flonum</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>real</td>            <td>=</td>  <td>fixnum + bignum + ratnum + flonum</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>complex</td>         <td>=</td>  <td>rectangular + compnum</td>
</tr>
</table>

<P>
These domain equations are typical of most implementations, but
many variations are possible.  The flonum representation type,
for example, is often divided into several distinct precisions.

<h3><a name="ComplexIssuesRepresentationSpecificOperations">Representation-specific Operations</a></h3>

<P>
A naive implementation of Scheme's arithmetic operations is slow
compared to the arithmetic operations of most other languages,
mainly because most operations must perform some sort of case
dispatch on the representation types of their arguments.  The
potential for this case dispatch arises when the type of an
operation's argument is represented by a union of two or more
representation types, or because the operation is required to
signal an error when given an argument of an incorrect type.
(The second reason can be regarded as a special case of the
first.)

<P>
To make Scheme's arithmetic more efficient, many implementations
provide sets of operations whose domain is restricted to a single
representation type, and which are not expected to signal an error
when given arguments of incorrect type.

<P>
Alternatively, or in addition, several compilers perform some
kind of flow analysis that attempts to infer the representation
types of expressions.  When a single representation type can be
inferred for each argument of an operation, and those types
match the types expected by some representation-specific version
of the operation, then the compiler can substitute the specific
version for the more general version that was specified in the
source code.


<h3><a name="ComplexIssuesFlowAnalysis">Flow Analysis</a></h3>

<P>
Flow analysis is performed by solving the type and interval
constraints that arise from such things as:
</P>

<ul>
<li> the types of literal constants, e.g. 2 is an exact integer
    that is known to be within the interval [2,2]
</li>

<li> conditional control flow that is predicated on known
    inequalities, e.g. <code>`(if (< i n) E1 E2)'</code>
</li>

<li> conditional control flow that is predicated on known type
    predicates, e.g. <code>`(if (real? x) &lt;real_case&gt; &lt;unreal_case&gt;)'</code>

<li> the closure properties of known operations (for example,
    <code>`(+ &lt;flonum&gt; &lt;flonum&gt;)'</code> always evaluates to a flonum)
</li>
</ul>

<P>
The purpose of flow analysis (as motivated in this note) is to
infer a single representation type for each argument of an
operation.  That places a premium on predicates and closure
properties from which a single representation type can be
inferred.
</P>

<h3><a name="ComplexIssuesFlowAnalysisProblems">Problems With Flow Analysis</a></h3>

<P>
In practice, the most important single representation types are
fixnum, flonum, and compnum.  These are the representation types
for which a short sequence of machine code can be generated when
the representation type is known, but for which considerably less
efficient code will probably have to be generated when the
representation type cannot be inferred.

<P>
The fixnum representation type is not closed under any R5RS
operations, so it is hard for flow analysis to infer the fixnum
type from portable R5RS code.  Sometimes the combination of a
more general type (e.g. exact integer) and an interval (e.g.
[0,n), where n is known to be a fixnum) can imply the fixnum
representation type.  Adding fixnum-specific operations that
map fixnums to fixnums (by computing modulo 2^n, say) greatly
increases the number of fixnum representation types that a
compiler can infer.

<P>
The flonum representation type is not closed under operations
such as <code>sqrt</code> and <code>expt</code>, so flow analysis tends to break down in
the presence of those operations.  This is unfortunate, because
those operations are normally used only with arguments for which
the result is expected to be a flonum.  Adding flonum-specific
versions such as <code>flsqrt</code> and <code>flexpt</code> improves the effectiveness
of flow analysis.

<P>
The R5RS creates a more insidious problem by defining <code>`(real? <var>z</var>)'</code>
to be true if and only if <code>`(zero? (imag-part <var>z</var>))'</code> is true.  This
means, for example, that <code>-2.5+0.0i</code> is real.  If <code>-2.5+0.0i</code> is
represented as a compnum, then the compiler cannot rely on x
being a flonum during the &lt;real_case&gt; of
<code>`(if (real? x) &lt;real_case&gt; &lt;unreal_case&gt;)'</code>.  This problem could
be fixed by writing all of the arithmetic operations so that
any compnum with a zero imaginary part is converted to a flonum
before it is returned, but that merely creates an analogous
problem for compnum arithmetic, as explained below.  A better
way to fix the problem is as Lucier recommended: change the
definition of Scheme's real numbers by defining <code>`(real? <var>z</var>)'</code> to
be true if and only if <code>`(imag-part <var>z</var>)'</code> is an exact zero.

<P>
The compnum representation type is closed under virtually all
operations, provided no operation that accepts two compnums as
its argument ever returns a flonum.  To work around the problem
described in the paragraph above, several implementations
automatically convert compnums with a zero imaginary part to
the flonum representation.  This practice virtually destroys
the effectiveness of flow analysis for inferring the compnum
representation, so it is not a good workaround.  To improve
the effectiveness of flow analysis, it is better to change
the definition of Scheme's real numbers as described in the
paragraph above.


<h2><a name="Recommendations">Recommendations</a></h2>

<P>
To improve the effectiveness of flow analysis and to improve
the efficiency of arithmetic, I recommend that the R6RS:

<ul>
<li> add fixnum-specific operations, e.g. <code>fx+</code></li>
<li> add flonum-specific operations, e.g. <code>fl+</code></li>
<li> change the definition of real numbers so that a complex
    number is real if and only if its imaginary part is an
    exact zero</li>
<li> change the interpretation of literals accordingly, e.g.
    so <code>`(imag-part 2.0)'</code> is an exact zero
</ul>

<h2><a name="FlonumsReals">Flonums</a></h2>

<P>
When flonum-specific operations are added to Scheme, should
they take any inexact real as arguments?  Or should their
arguments be restricted to some subtype of the inexact reals?

<P>
Another way to describe this issue is to specify that the
flonum-specific operations take flonums as arguments and
return flonums as results.  Then the question becomes:
Are the flonums coextensive with the inexact reals?  Or
are the flonums allowed to be a proper subset of the
inexact reals?

<P>
I do not think this question is terribly important.  Most
current implementations have only one representation for
inexact reals, and having only one representation for the
inexact reals improves the effectiveness of flow analysis,
so implementations that try to provide efficient arithmetic
on inexact reals are likely to make "flonum" synonymous with
"inexact real" even if the R6RS allows otherwise.

<P>
One reason for allowing "flonum" to be a proper subtype of
"inexact real" is to give implementations freedom to
experiment with unusual representation strategies.
Another possibility is that an implementation might take
"flonum" to mean the representation that is supported most
efficiently by the hardware, e.g. IEEE double precision,
while providing other precisions that might be more
space-efficient for certain applications.

<P>
On the other hand, defining "flonum" to be a synonym for
"inexact real" would simplify the presentation of flonum
arithmetic, and would eliminate a couple of procedures that
would otherwise have to be provided and somehow specified
(e.g. <code>real-&gt;flonum</code> and <code>flonum?</code>).

<P>
I recommend that the R6RS define "flonum" as a synonym for
"inexact real", but this is not a strong recommendation.
It doesn't matter very much.

<H1><a name="ReferenceImplementation">Reference Implementation</a></H1>

<P>
The <a href="arithmetic-reference.tar.gz">reference implementation</a>
contains a reference implementation for the procedures described here,
written in mostly R5RS Scheme, and based purely on integer and flonum
arithmetic of the underlying Scheme implementation.  It builds the
entire numeric tower on fixnums and flonums.  The code is set up to
run under Scheme 48, but should be easy to adapt to other Scheme
systems.
</P>
